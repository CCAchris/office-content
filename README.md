## Ways to contribute

You can contribute to [Office developer documentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn467914(v=office.15).aspx) in a few different ways:

* Contribute to articles via the [public Azure repo](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-content)
* Report documentation bugs via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-content/issues)
* Add documentation requests to the [Office/SharePoint developer UserVoice](http://officespdev.uservoice.com)

## Repository organization

The content in the office-content repository is grouped first by article language, then by topic. The README.md file at the root of each topic directory specifies the structure of the articles within the topic.

Article within each topic are named by MSDN GUID rather than title name. This is a side effect of our document management process and cannot be changed at this time. We highly recommend using the table of contents within each topic directory (see links below) to navigate to the files you wish to view or edit.
