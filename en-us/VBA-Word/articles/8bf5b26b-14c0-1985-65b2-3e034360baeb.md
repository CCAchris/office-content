Contains the view attributes (such as show all, field shading, and table gridlines) for a window or pane.

## Remarks

Use the  **View** property to return the **View** object. The following example sets view options for the active window.


```
With ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View 
 .ShowAll = True 
 .TableGridlines = True 
 .WrapToWindow = False 
End With
```

Use the  **Type**property to change the view. The following example switches the active window to normal view.




```
ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.Type = wdNormalView
```

Use the  **Percentage**property to change the size of the text on-screen. The following example enlarges the on-screen text to 120 percent.




```
ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.Zoom.Percentage = 120
```

Use the  **SeekView**property to view comments, endnotes, footnotes, or the document header or footer. The following example displays the current footer in the active window in print layout view.




```
With ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View 
 .Type = wdPrintView 
 .SeekView = wdSeekCurrentPageFooter 
End With
```
