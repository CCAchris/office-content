 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Opens a Excel data grid window that contains the full source data for the specified chart.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ActivateChartDataWindow**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ChartData** object.


### Return value

 **VOID**


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If the data grid window is already open, this method has no effect.

The  **ActivateChartDataWindow** method differs from the [ChartData.Activate](08f4a657-41c2-52ea-b31c-976549ace8c1.md) method in that the former opens the chart in an Excel window within Word, with the Excel ribbon unavailable, whereas the latter opens a full version of Excel, with the ribbon available.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example shows how to activate the chart data window for the chart that is at the first index position in the collection of shapes in the active document.


```

Public Sub ActivateChartDataWindow_Example()

    ThisDocument.Shapes(1).Chart.ChartData.ActivateChartDataWindow

End Sub

```
