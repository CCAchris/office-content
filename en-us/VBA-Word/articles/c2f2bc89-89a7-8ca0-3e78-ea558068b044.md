### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Path|Required| **String**|The path for the network drive (for example, "\\Project\Info").|
|Drive|Optional| **Variant**|A number corresponding to the letter you want to assign to the network drive, where 0 (zero) corresponds to the first available drive letter, 1 corresponds to the second available drive letter, and so on. If this argument is omitted, the next available letter is used.|
|Password|Optional| **Variant**|The password, if the network drive is protected with a password.|

## Security
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Avoid using hard-coded passwords in your applications. If a password is required in a procedure, request the password from the user, store it in a variable, and then use the variable in your code. For recommended best practices on how to do this, see  [Security Notes for Microsoft Office Solution Developers](HV01051489.md). 


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

Use the  **Dialogs**property with the  **wdDialogConnect** constant to display the **Connect To Network Drive** dialog box. The following example displays the **Connect To Network Drive** dialog box, with a preset path shown.


```
With Dialogs(wdDialogConnect) 
 .Path = "\\Marketing\Public" 
 .Show 
End With
```


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

This example establishes a connection to a network drive (\\Project\Info) protected with the password contained in the String variable, and then assigns the network drive to the next available drive letter.


```
System.Connect Path:="\\Project\Info", Password:=strPassword
```

This example establishes a connection to a network drive (\\Team1\Public) and assigns the network drive to the third available drive letter.




```
System.Connect Path:="\\Team1\Public", Drive:=2
```
