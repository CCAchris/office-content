Represents the mail merge data source in a mail merge operation.

## Remarks

Use the  **DataSource** property to return the **MailMergeDataSource** object. The following example displays the name of the data source associated with the active document.


```
If ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DataSource.Name <> "" Then _ 
 MsgBox ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DataSource.Name
```

The following example displays the field names in the data source associated with the active document.




```
For Each aField In ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DataSource.FieldNames 
 MsgBox aField.Name

 .EditDataSource 
 If .DataSource.FindRecord(FindText:="Kate", _ 
 Field:="FirstName") = True Then 
 MsgBox "Data was found" 
 End If 
End With
