 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns or sets a value that specifies whether the specified rows can overlap other rows.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **AllowOverlap**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [Rows](cd83d0ef-f743-1886-54de-497017c5f542.md)** collection.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This property returns  **wdUndefined** if the specified rows include both overlapping rows and nonoverlapping rows. Can be set to either **True** or **False**. Read/write  **Long**. Setting  **AllowOverlap** to **True** also sets **WrapAroundText** to **True**, and setting  **WrapAroundText** to **False** also sets **AllowOverlap** to **False**.

Because HTML doesn't support overlapping tables or shapes,  **AllowOverlap** is ignored in Web layout view.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example specifies that text wraps around the selected table and that the table doesn't overlap any other wrapped tables.


```
Selection.Rows.WrapAroundText = True 
Selection.Rows.AllowOverlap = False
```

This example specifies that the first shape in the active document can overlap other shapes.




```
ActiveDocument.Shapes(1).WrapFormat.AllowOverlap = True
```
