# OMaths Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of equations. Use the  **OMath** object to access individual members of the collection.

## Remarks

Use the  **Add** method to create an equation and add it to a document, selection, or range. The following example creates an equation and uses the **BuildUp** method of the **OMath** collection to convert the equation to professional format.


```
Dim objRange As Range 
Dim objEq As OMath 
 
Set objRange = Selection.Range 
objRange.Text = "Celsius = (5/9)(Fahrenheit - 32)" 
Set objRange = Selection.OMaths.Add(objRange) 
Set objEq = objRange.OMaths(1) 
objEq.BuildUp
```
