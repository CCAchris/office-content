 **True** disables all features introduced after the version specified in the ** [DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfter](5714062c-ffca-8feb-6b25-52f71568ae12.md)**property. The default value is  **False**. Read/write  **Boolean**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **DisableFeatures**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [Document](8d83487a-2345-a036-a916-971c9db5b7fb.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **DisableFeatures** property only affects the document for which you set the property. Use this property if you plan on sharing a document between users with earlier versions of Microsoft Word so that you don't end up introducing into a document features that are not available in their versions.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example disables all features added after Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0 and 7.0a, for the current document. The global default setting remains unchanged.


```
Sub FeaturesDisable() 
 With ActiveDocument 
 
 'Checks whether features are disabled 
 If .DisableFeatures = True Then 
 
 'If they are, disables all features after Word for Windows 95 
 .DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfter = wd70 
 Else 
 
 'If not, turns on the disable features option and disables 
 'all features introduced after Word for Windows 95 
 .DisableFeatures = True 
 .DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfter = wd70 
 End If 
 End With 
End Sub
```
