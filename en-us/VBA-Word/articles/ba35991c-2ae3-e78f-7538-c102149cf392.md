## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **MoveWhile**( **_Cset_**,  **_Count_**)

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Cset|Required| **Variant**|One or more characters. This argument is case sensitive.|
|Count|Optional| **Variant**|The maximum number of characters by which the specified selection is to be moved. Can be a number or either the  **wdForward** or **wdBackward** constant. If Count is a positive number, the specified selection is moved forward in the document, beginning at the end position. If it is a negative number, the selection is moved backward, beginning at the start position. The default value is **wdForward**.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

While any character in Cset is found, the specified selection is moved. The resulting  **Selection** object is positioned as an insertion point after whatever Cset characters were found. This method returns the number of characters by which the specified selection was moved, as a **Long** value. If no Cset characters are found, the selection isn't changed and the method returns 0 (zero).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example moves the selection after consecutive tabs.


```
Selection.MoveWhile Cset:=vbTab, Count:=wdForward
```
