## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ScreenRefresh**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents an  ** [Application](d1cf6f8f-4e88-bf01-93b4-90a83f79cb44.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

You can use this method after using the  **ScreenUpdating** property to disable screen updates. **ScreenRefresh** turns on screen updating for just one instruction and then immediately turns it off. Subsequent instructions don't update the screen until screen updating is turned on again with the **ScreenUpdating** property.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example turns off screen updating, opens Test.doc, inserts text, refreshes the screen, and then closes the document (with changes saved).


```
Dim rngTemp As Range 
 
ScreenUpdating = False 
Documents.Open FileName:="C:\DOCS\TEST.DOC" 
 
Set rngTemp = ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=0, End:=0) 
 
rngTemp.InsertBefore "new" 
Application.ScreenRefresh 
ActiveDocument.Close SaveChanges:=wdSaveChanges 
ScreenUpdating = True
```
