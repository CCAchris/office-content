# EmailSignatureEntry Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a single e-mail signature entry. The  **EmailSignatureEntry** object is a member of the ** [EmailSignatureEntries](42a63f45-f989-be32-e75a-059c9a77c6f1.md)** collection. The **EmailSignatureEntries** collection contains all the e-mail signature entries available to Word.

## Remarks

Use  **EmailSignatureEntries**(Index), where Index is the e-mail signature entry name or item number, to return a single  **EmailSignatureEntry** object. You must match exactly the spelling (but not necessarily the capitalization) of the name. The following example uses the ** [Delete](7b6856f4-f963-7ccd-e29b-fb2634cb3059.md)**method to delete the signature entry named "Jeff Smith."


```
Sub DeleteSignature() 
 Application.EmailOptions.EmailSignature _ 
 .EmailSignatureEntries("jeff smith").Delete 
End Sub
```
