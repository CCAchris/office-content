```
Dim objUndo As UndoRecord 
 
Sub MyFunction() 
 Set objUndo = Application.UndoRecord 
 
 ' Verify that a custom undo record is already being recorded, and if not, start one 
 If objUndo.IsRecordingCustomRecord = False Then 
 objUndo.StartCustomRecord("New Undo Record") 
 End If 
 ' Add some actions here. 
 objUndo.EndCustomRecord 
 
 ' Verify that any custom undo action calls are currently active. 
 If objUndo.CustomRecordLevel > 0 Then 
 Debug.Print "An undo record call was not closed!" 
 End If 
End Sub
