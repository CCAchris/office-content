# EmailSignature Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains information about the e-mail signatures used by Microsoft Word when you create and edit e-mail messages and replies.

## Remarks

Use the  **EmailSignature**property to return the  **EmailSignature** object.

This example changes the signatures Word appends to new outgoing e-mail messages and e-mail message replies.




```
With Application.EmailOptions.EmailSignature 
 .NewMessageSignature = "Signature1" 
 .ReplyMessageSignature = "Reply2" 
End With
```


 **Note**  There is no EmailSignatures collection; each  ** [EmailOptions](41fefa03-c993-e218-0f92-0cf30c0bfbd4.md)**object contains only one  **EmailSignature** object.
