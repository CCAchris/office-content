## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **InsertParagraph**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

After this method has been used, the range is the new paragraph.

If you don't want to replace the range, use the  **Collapse** method before using this method. The **InsertParagraphAfter** method inserts a new paragraph following a **Range** object.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example inserts a new paragraph at the beginning of the active document.


```
Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Range(0, 0) 
With myRange 
 .InsertParagraph 
 .InsertBefore "Dear Sirs," 
End With
```
