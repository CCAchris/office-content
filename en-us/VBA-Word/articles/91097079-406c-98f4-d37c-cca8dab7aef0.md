 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Sets the starting and ending character positions for an existing range.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **SetRange**( **_Start_**,  **_End_**)

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Start|Required| **Long**|The starting character position of the range.|
|End|Required| **Long**|The ending character position of the range.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Character position values start at the beginning of the story, with the first value being 0 (zero). All characters are counted, including nonprinting characters. Hidden characters are counted even if they're not displayed.

The  **SetRange** method redefines the starting and ending positions of an existing **Range** object. This method differs from the **Range** method, which is used to create a range, given a starting and ending position.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses  **SetRange** to redefine _myRange_ to refer to the first three paragraphs in the active document.


```
Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range 
myRange.SetRange Start:=myRange.Start, _ 
 End:=ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(3).Range.End
```

This example uses  **SetRange** to redefine _myRange_ to refer to the area starting at the beginning of the document and ending at the end of the current selection.




```
Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=0, End:=0) 
myRange.InsertAfter "Hello " 
myRange.SetRange Start:=myRange.Start, End:=Selection.End
```
