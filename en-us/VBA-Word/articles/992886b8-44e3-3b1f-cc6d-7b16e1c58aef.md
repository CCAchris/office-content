Sets the reading order and alignment of the specified paragraphs to left-to-right.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **LtrPara**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

For all selected paragraphs, this method sets the reading order to left-to-right. If a paragraph with a right-to-left reading order is also right-aligned, this method reverses its reading order and sets its paragraph alignment to left-aligned.

Use the  **ReadingOrder**property to change the reading order without affecting paragraph alignment.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example sets the reading order and alignment of the current selection to left-to-right if the selection is styled as "Normal."


```
If Selection.Style = "Normal" Then _ 
 Selection.LtrPara
```
