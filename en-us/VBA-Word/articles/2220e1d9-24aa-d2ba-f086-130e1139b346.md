 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)

 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Groups the shapes in the specified range, and returns the grouped shapes as a single  **Shape** object.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Group**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [ShapeRange](7112acc0-e241-16ef-77bc-101b72d05af0.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Because a group of shapes is treated as a single shape, grouping and ungrouping shapes changes the number of items in the  **Shapes** collection and changes the index numbers of items that come after the affected items in the collection.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example adds two shapes to myDocument, groups the two new shapes, sets the fill for the group, rotates the group, and sends the group to the back of the drawing layer.


```
Set myDocument = ActiveDocument 
With myDocument.Shapes 
 .AddShape(msoShapeCan, 50, 10, 100, 200).Name = "shpOne" 
 .AddShape(msoShapeCube, 150, 250, 100, 200).Name = "shpTwo" 
 With .Range(Array("shpOne", "shpTwo")).Group 
 .Fill.PresetTextured msoTextureBlueTissuePaper 
 .Rotation = 45 
 .ZOrder msoSendToBack 
 End With 
End With
```
