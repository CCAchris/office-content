Inserts the contents of the Clipboard at the specified selection.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Paste**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Using this method replaces the contents of the current selection. If you don't want to replace the contents of the selection, use the  ** [Collapse](92ccd3dc-41ab-b3d4-5397-fca7d7f01635.md)** method before using this method.

When you use this method with a  **Range** object, the range expands to include the contents of the Clipboard. When you use this method with a **Selection** object, the selection does not expand to include the Clipboard contents; instead, the selection is positioned after the pasted Clipboard contents.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example copies the first paragraph in the document and pastes it at the insertion point.


```
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range.Copy 
Selection.Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseStart 
Selection.Paste
```
