Reloads a cached document by resolving the hyperlink to the document and downloading it.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Reload**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Document](8d83487a-2345-a036-a916-971c9db5b7fb.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This method reloads the document asynchronously; that is, statements following the  **Reload** method in your procedure may execute before the document is actually reloaded. Because of this, you may get unexpected results from using this method in your macros.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example opens and reloads the hyperlink to the address "main" on a local intranet.


```
With ActiveDocument 
 .FollowHyperlink Address:="http://main" 
 .Reload 
End With
```
