Sets the starting and ending character positions for the selection.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **SetRange**( **_Start_**,  **_End_**)

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Start|Required| **Long**|The starting character position of the selection.|
|End|Required| **Long**|The ending character position of the selection.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Character position values start at the beginning of the story, with the first value being 0 (zero). All characters are counted, including nonprinting characters. Hidden characters are counted even if they're not displayed.

The  **SetRange** method redefines the starting and ending positions of an existing **Selection** object. This method differs from the **Range** method, which is used to create a **Range** object, given a starting and ending position.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example selects the first 10 characters in the document.


```
Selection.SetRange Start:=0, End:=10
```

This example extends the selection to the end of the document.




```
Selection.SetRange Start:=Selection.Start, _ 
 End:=ActiveDocument.Content.End
```
