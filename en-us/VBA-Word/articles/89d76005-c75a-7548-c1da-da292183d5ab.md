## Remarks

There are four types of paragraph alignment: left, centered, right, and justified.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example positions the insertion point at the beginning of the first paragraph after the current paragraph that doesn't have the same alignment as the current paragraph. If the alignment is the same from the selection to the end of the document, the example moves the selection to the end of the document and displays a message.


```
Selection.SelectCurrentAlignment 
Selection.Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseEnd 
If Selection.End = ActiveDocument.Content.End - 1 Then 
 MsgBox "No change in alignment found." 
End If
