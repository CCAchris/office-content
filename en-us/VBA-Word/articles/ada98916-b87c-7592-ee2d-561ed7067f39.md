Returns a  **Words** collection that represents all the words in a range. Read-only.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Words**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Punctuation and paragraph marks in a document are included in the  **Words** collection.

For information about returning a single member of a collection, see  [Returning an Object from a Collection](28f76384-f495-9640-a7c8-10ada3fac727.md).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example displays the number of words in the selection. Paragraphs marks, partial words, and punctuation are included in the count.


```
MsgBox "There are " &amp; Selection.Words.Count &amp; " words."
```

This example steps through the words in  _myRange_ (which spans from the beginning of the active document to the end of the selection) and deletes the word "Franklin" (including the trailing space) wherever it occurs in the range.




```
Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=0, End:=Selection.End) 
For Each aWord In myRange.Words 
 If aWord.Text = "Franklin " Then aWord.Delete 
Next aWord
```
