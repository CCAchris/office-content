## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **IncrementRotation**(Increment)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ShapeRange** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Increment|Required| **Single**|The number of degrees each shape is to be rotated. A positive value rotates the shapes clockwise; a negative value rotates the shapes counterclockwise.|
|Increment|Required|FLOAT||

### Return value

 **Nothing**


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The Increment parameter can be a value from -3600 to 3600.


## Example

The following example shows the difference between rotating a shape and rotating a shape range. The example creates a shape range that contains two cylinders, rotates the shape range 30 degrees clockwise, and then rotates the second shape in the range 30 degrees counterclockwise. If you set a breakpoint on the last  **IncrementRotation** statement, and then step through the code, you can see how the rotation works.


```
Sub RotateShapes()
    Dim theReport As Report
    Dim shp1 As shape
    Dim shp2 As shape
    Dim shpGroup As shape
    Dim reportName As String
    Dim sRange1 As ShapeRange
    
    reportName = "Rotate Report"
    
    Set theReport = ActiveProject.Reports.Add(reportName)
    Set shp1 = theReport.Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeCan, 20, 30, 100, 100)
    Set shp2 = theReport.Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeCan, 140, 30, 100, 100)
        
    Set sRange1 = theReport.Shapes.Range(Array(1, 2))
    sRange1.IncrementRotation 30

    sRange1(2).IncrementRotation -30
End Sub
```
