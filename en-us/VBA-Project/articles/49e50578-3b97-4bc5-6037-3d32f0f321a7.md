Sub ToggleDropLines()
    Dim chartShape As Shape
    Dim chartGroup As Office.IMsoChartGroup
    Dim dropLines As Boolean
    Dim reportName As String
    
    reportName = "Simple line chart"
    Set chartShape = ActiveProject.Reports(reportName).Shapes(1)
    
    Set chartGroup = chartShape.Chart.ChartGroups(1)
    dropLines = chartGroup.HasDropLines
    
    MsgBox "Chart group in " &amp; reportName &amp; ": " _
