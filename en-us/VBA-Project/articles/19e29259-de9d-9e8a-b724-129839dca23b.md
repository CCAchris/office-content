 Response = MsgBox("Overallocated resources are leveled from " &amp; _ 
 "the project start date. Should that be changed?", vbYesNo) 
 If Response = vbYes Then 
 NewFrom = InputBox("Date to level from: ") 
 .LevelFromDate = NewFrom 
 Else 
 MsgBox "Resources remain leveled from the project start date." 
 End If 
 End If 
 
 If Application.DateDifference(.ProjectSummaryTask.Finish, .LevelToDate) = 0 Then 
 Response = MsgBox("Overallocated resources are leveled to " &amp; _ 
 "the project finish date. Should that be changed?", vbYesNo) 
 If Response = vbYes Then 
 NewTo = InputBox("Date to level to: ") 
 .LevelToDate = NewTo
