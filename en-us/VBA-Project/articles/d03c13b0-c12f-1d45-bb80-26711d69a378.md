### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Name|Optional| **String**|The name of the project file, source file, or data source to open. If Name is not specified, Project displays the **Open** dialog box.|
|ReadOnly|Optional| **Boolean**| **True** if the file is opened read-only. If selectively importing data instead of loading a complete project,ReadOnly is ignored.|
|Merge|Optional| **Long**|Specifies whether to automatically merge the file (MPX and XMLDOM formats only) with the active project. To automatically merge XLS, CSV, or TXT file formats, you can set the merge key in the import map that you are using. The Map argument should be used in place ofMerge, which is included for backward compatibility. If Map is specified,Merge is ignored. Can be one of the [PjMergeType](040c6814-1631-40c6-6444-1ad7e9405082.md) constants. The default value is **pjDoNotMerge**.|
|TaskInformation|Optional| **Boolean**| **True** if the file contains information on tasks for a project saved under a non-Project file format. **False** if the file contains information on resources. TheMap argument should be used in place ofTaskInformation, which is included for backward compatibility. If Map is specified,TaskInformation is ignored. The default value is **True** if the active view is a task view; otherwise it is **False**.|
|Table|Optional| **String**|The name of a table in which to place the resource or task information for a project saved under a non-Project file format. Table is required if the value of theMerge argument is **pjMerge**. The Map argument should be used in place ofTable, which is included for backward compatibility. If Map is specified, orName specifies a database file or format,Table is ignored. The default value forTable is the name of the active table.|
|Sheet|Optional| **String**|The sheet to read when opening a workbook created in Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or later. The Map argument should be used in place ofSheet, which is included for backward compatibility. If Map is specified, or if the file specified byName is not a Microsoft Excel file,Sheet is ignored.|
|NoAuto|Optional| **Boolean**| **True** if any **Auto_Open** macro is prevented from running. The default value is **False**.|
|UserID|Optional| **String**|A user ID to use when accessing a database. If Name orFormatID is not a database,UserID is ignored.|
|DatabasePassWord|Optional| **String**|A password to use when accessing a database. If Name orFormatID is not a database,DatabasePassWord is ignored.|
|FormatID|Optional| **String**|Specifies the file or database format to use. If Project recognizes the format of the file specified with Name, FormatID is ignored.FormatID can be one of the following values:

|**Format String**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|"MSProject.mpp"|Project file|
|"MSProject.mpt"|Project template|
|"MSProject.mpp.8"|Project 98 file|
|"MSProject.mpp.9" |Project 2000 - 2003 file|
|"MSProject.mpp.12"|Project 2007 file|
|"MSProject.odbc|Open a project from an ODBC database|
|"MSProject.xls"|Microsoft Excel workbook|
|"MSProject.xls5"|Microsoft Excel 97-2003 workbook|
|"MSProject.pdf"|PDF file|
|"MSProject.xpf"|XPF file|
|"MSProject.csv"|CSV (Comma delimited) file|
|"MSProject.txt"|TXT (Tab delimited) file|
|"MSProject.xml"|Project XML file|
|
|Map|Optional| **String**|The name of the import/export map to use when importing data.|
|openPool|Optional| **Long**|The action to take when opening a resource pool or sharer file. When opening a master project, the value for openPool is also applied to the subprojects. Can be one of the [PjPoolOpen](d953d1cb-f8f9-740a-f20c-6ac1e2ee0366.md) constants. The default value is **pjPromptPool**.|
|Password|Optional| **String**|A password to use when opening password-protected project files. If Password is incorrect or omitted and a file requires a password, the user is prompted for the password.|
|WriteResPassword|Optional| **String**|A password to use when writing to a write-reserved project file. If WriteResPassword is omitted and the file requires a password, the user is prompted for the password.|
|IgnoreReadOnlyRecommended|Optional| **BooleanVariant**| **True** to prevent Project from displaying an alert that the project should be opened read-only. If the project was not saved with a read-only recommendation,IgnoreReadOnlyRecommended is ignored.|
|XMLName|Optional| **Variant**|This is the XML DOM object that is passed to the function when FormatID is MSProject.XML. The **FileSaveAs** method fails if the XML format is specified andXMLName is not a valid XML DOM object. IfFormatID is anything other than MSProject.XML,XMLName should be **NULL** and the method should fail otherwise. Only one ofXMLName orName can be specified.|
|DoNotLoadFromEnterprise|Optional| **Boolean**| **True**, if the project is not to be opened from Project Server. The default is  **False**, where Project Professional opens the file from Project Server, or from the local computer if Project Professional is not logged on Project Server.|

### Return Value

 **Boolean**


## Remarks

Using the  **FileOpenEx** method without specifying any arguments displays the **Open** dialog box with the list of enterprise projects if Project Professional is logged on Project Server. Using `FileOpenEx DoNotLoadFromEnterprise:=True` displays the **Open** dialog box for project files on the local computer.

If you use the  **FileOpenEx** method to open a project that is published to Project Server, it opens the file from the Draft database. For example, to programmatically open a project named Project1 as read/write from Project Server, use the following command: `Application.FileOpenEx Name:="<>\Project1"`.

If you do not want to modify a project, set the ReadOnly parameter to **True**. For example, to open Project2 as read-only, use the following command:  `Application.FileOpenEx Name:="<>\Project2", ReadOnly:=True`. To save the file in the Draft database, use the  **Application.FileSave** method. To publish the file from the Draft to the Published database, so that changes are shown to other users, use the **Application.Publish** method.

The Name parameter can contain a file name string or an ODBC data source name (DSN) and project name string. The syntax for a data source is <DataSourceName>\Projectname. The less than (<) and greater than (>) symbols must be included, and a backslash ( \ ) must separate the data source name from the project name.DataSourceName itself can either be one of the ODBC data source names installed on the computer or a path and file name for a file-based database.
