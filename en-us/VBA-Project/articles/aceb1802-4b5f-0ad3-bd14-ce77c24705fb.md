## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ResourceAssignment**( **_Resources_**,  **_Operation_**,  **_With_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Resources|Optional| **String**|The names of the resources to be assigned, removed, or replaced in the selected tasks.
 **Note**  Project will not assign a resource if thousands separators or decimal separators are included in the unit values.

|
|Operation|Optional| **Long**|If Operation is omitted, Project assigns the resources to the selected tasks. The default value is **pjAssign**. Can be one of the following  **PjResAssignOperation** constants:

|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
||
| **pjAssign**|Assigns the specified resources to the selected tasks.|
| **pjRemove**|Removes the specified resources from the selected tasks.|
| **pjReplace**|The resources specified by With replace the resources specified withResources.|
| **pjChange**|Changes the resource units for the specified resource. This constant can be used only for a single resource.|
|
|With|Optional| **String**|When used with the  **pjReplace** constant forOperation, specifies the names of the resources that replace the resources of the selected tasks.|

### Return Value

 **Boolean**


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

You can use the Resources parameter to specify that a resource assignment is requested or demanded when using the Resource Substitution Wizard. For example, the following macro specifies that the assignment of r1 to the selected task is a requested assignment.


```
Sub RequestAssignment()
    ResourceAssignment Resources:="r1[100%, R]", Operation:=pjChange, With:="" 
End Sub
```


 **Note**  When using the Resources parameter in this way, **D** specifies "Demand," **R** specifies "Request," and **N** specifies "None." In addition, spaces are not allowed between the units value and the Request/Demand value. For example, `Resources:="100%,R"` works, but `Resources:="100%, R"` does not.

The Resource Substitution Wizard cannot substitute material resources. Therefore, you cannot request or demand a material resource for a particular assignment using the Resources parameter.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example prompts the user for the name of a resource, and then assigns that resource to the selected tasks.


```
Sub AssignResourceToSelectedTasks() 
 
    Dim Entry As String     ' The name of the resource to add to selected tasks 
    Dim R As Resource       ' Resource object used in For Each...Next loop 
    Dim Found As Boolean    ' Whether or not the resource is in the active project 
 
    Entry = InputBox$("Enter the name of the resource you want to add to the selected tasks.") 
     
    ' Assume resource doesn't exist in the active project. 
    Found = False 
 
    ' Look for the resource. 
    For Each R In ActiveProject.Resources 
        If Entry = R.Name Then Found = True 
    Next R 
 
    ' If the resource is found, then assign it to selected tasks. 
    If Found Then 
        ResourceAssignment Resources:=Entry, Operation:=pjAssign 
    ' Otherwise, tell user the resource doesn't exist. 
    Else 
        MsgBox ("There is no resource in the active project named " &amp; Entry &amp; ".") 
    End If 
     
End Sub
```
