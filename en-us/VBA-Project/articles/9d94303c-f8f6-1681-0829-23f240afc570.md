|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Project events do not occur when the project is embedded in another document or application.

The  **ProjectBeforeAssignmentChange** event doesn't occur when timescaled data changes, when an entire resource or task row is pasted, when an assignment is changed as the result of a drag-and-drop operation in the Resource Usage view, during resource pool operations, when inserting or removing a subproject, or when changes have been made using a custom form. For more information and sample code for creating and testing an event handler, see [Using Events with Application and Project Objects](64a18885-f203-c298-db11-f9e8e75bb7b6.md).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example examines new resource assignments and cancels them if they are for the specified resource. This example requires a new class module and additional code for it to have an effect.


```
Private Sub App_ProjectBeforeAssignmentChange(ByVal asg As Assignment, ByVal Field As PjAssignmentField, _ 
    ByVal NewVal As Variant, Cancel As Boolean) 
 
    If Field = pjAssignmentResourceName And NewVal = "Lisa Jones" Then 
        MsgBox "Lisa is no longer available for assignment!" 
        Cancel = True 
    End If 
End Sub
```
