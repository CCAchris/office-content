|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Name|Optional| **String**|The name of the view to display in the active window.|

|
|BuiltInView|Optional| **PjViewType**|Specifies a built-in view. Can be one of the  ** [PjViewType](b9173645-e4f9-e514-a5a3-1d57241e3a66.md)** constants. The default is **pjViewUndefined**. BuiltInView is ignored ifName is specified.|

### Return Value

 **Boolean**


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>




 **Note**  In a combination view, the primary pane is the view that remains when a details or secondary pane is closed. Usually the primary pane is at the top; however, the Timeline is a secondary pane, but it displays at the top. For example, with the Resource Sheet view, clicking  **Details** on the **View** tab on the ribbon shows the secondary Resource Form pane on the bottom. Clicking **Timeline** closes the Resource Form at the bottom and opens the Timeline pane at the top.

The Gantt Chart view cannot be combined with the Team Planner view. Some views, such as the Calendar view, cannot be displayed in a details pane. The  **ViewApply** method shows an error message, and then shows error 1004, "An unexpected error occurred with the method."


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example sets the single-pane active window to a combination view with the Gantt Chart in the lower pane. It assumes that the the active view is something other than the Gantt Chart.


```
Sub ChangeWindowToGanttChart() 
    ViewApplyEx Toggle:=True, BuiltInView:=pjViewGantt 
End Sub
```

If the current split view includes the Resource Usage and the Timeline views, where either pane is selected, the following example displays the Resource Usage view in the top pane and the Task Usage view in the bottom pane.




```
Sub ChangeSecondaryToTaskForm() 
    ViewApplyEx(Name:="Task Usage", ApplyTo:=1) 
End sub
```
