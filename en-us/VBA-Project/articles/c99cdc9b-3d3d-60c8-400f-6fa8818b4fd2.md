## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Elevation**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Chart** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The chart elevation is the angle from the horizontal at which you view the chart, in degrees. The default is 15 degrees for most chart types. The value of the  **Elevation** property must be between -90 and 90, except for 3-D bar charts, where it must be between 0 and 44. The **Elevation** property fails on 2-D charts.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example sets the elevation of the chart to 34 degrees. The example should be run on a 3-D chart.


```
Sub SetElevation()
    Dim chartShape As Shape
    Dim reportName As String
    
    reportName = "Simple 3D chart"
    Set chartShape = ActiveProject.Reports(reportName).Shapes(1)
    
    chartShape.Chart.Elevation = 34
End Sub
```
