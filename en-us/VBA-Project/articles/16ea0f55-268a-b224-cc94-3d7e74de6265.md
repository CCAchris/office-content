## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **AddCurve**(SafeArrayOfPoints)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shapes** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|SafeArrayOfPoints|Required| **Variant**|An array of coordinate pairs that specifies the vertices and control points of the curve.|
|SafeArrayOfPoints|Required|VARIANT||

### Return value

 **Shape**


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

For the SafeArrayOfPoints parameter, the first point you specify is the starting vertex, and the next two points are control points for the first BÃ©zier segment. Then, for each additional segment of the curve, you specify a vertex and two control points. The last point you specify is the ending vertex for the curve. Note that you must always specify 3 _n_ + 1 points, where _n_ is the number of segments in the curve.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example creates a curve that has seven vertices, starting at the upper-left corner of the report. The curve is set to a yellow-green line that is two points wide.


```
Sub AddBezierCurve()
    Dim shapeReport As Report
    Dim reportName As String
    Dim curveShape As shape
    
    ' Add a report.
    reportName = "Curve report"
    Set shapeReport = ActiveProject.Reports.Add(reportName)

    Dim pts(1 To 7, 1 To 2) As Single
    pts(1, 1) = 0
    pts(1, 2) = 0
    pts(2, 1) = 72
    pts(2, 2) = 72
    pts(3, 1) = 100
    pts(3, 2) = 40
    pts(4, 1) = 20
    pts(4, 2) = 50
    pts(5, 1) = 90
    pts(5, 2) = 120
    pts(6, 1) = 60
    pts(6, 2) = 30
    pts(7, 1) = 150
    pts(7, 2) = 90

    Set curveShape = shapeReport.Shapes.AddCurve(pts)

    With curveShape
        .Line.Weight = 2
        .Line.ForeColor.RGB = &amp;H1FFAA
    End With
End Sub
```
