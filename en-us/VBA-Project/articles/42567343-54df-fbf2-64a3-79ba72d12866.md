## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>




 **Note**  In a combination view, the primary pane is the view that remains when a details or secondary pane is closed. Usually the primary pane is at the top; however, the Timeline is a secondary pane, but it displays at the top. For example, with the Resource Sheet view, clicking  **Details** on the **View** tab of the Ribbon shows the secondary Resource Form pane on the bottom. Clicking **Timeline** closes the Resource Form at the bottom and opens the Timeline pane at the top.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

If the current view includes the Timeline and the Gantt Chart, where the Timeline is the active pane, the following example shows  **Timeline** selected in the **More Views** dialog box.


```
application.ViewsEx ApplyTo:=5
```
