The ** [SetBackgroundSoundRepeat](a699fa92-a36a-6722-431d-a0ce8413cfcf.md)** method can be used to specify whether the background sound should be played infinitely, and if it should not, to specify the number of times the background sound file should be played.

The background sound can be any of the following file types:



|*.wav|
|*.mid|
|*.midi|
|*.rmi|
|*.au|
|*.aif|
|*.aiff|

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example sets the background sound for page four of the active Web publication to a .wav file on the local computer. This .wav file will play once when the page is loaded in a Web browser.


```
Dim theWPO As WebPageOptions 
 
Set theWPO = ActiveDocument.Pages(4).WebPageOptions 
 
With theWPO 
 .BackgroundSound = "C:\CompanySounds\corporate_jingle.wav" 
End With
```
