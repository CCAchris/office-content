 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns a  **String** indicating the full path to the file of the saved active publication, not including the last separator or file name.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Path**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  ** [FullName](137e4310-8431-ed2a-503a-c225378a9a74.md)**property can be used to return both the path and file name.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example demonstrates the differences between the  **Path**,  **Name**, and  **FullName** properties. This example is best illustrated if the publication is saved in a folder other than the default.


```
Sub PathNames() 
 
 Dim strPath As String 
 Dim strName As String 
 Dim strFullName As String 
 
 strPath = Application.ActiveDocument.Path 
 strName = Application.ActiveDocument.Name 
 strFullName = Application.ActiveDocument.FullName 
 
 ' Note the file name &amp; path differences 
 ' while executing. 
 MsgBox "The path is: " &amp; strPath 
 MsgBox "The file name is: " &amp; strName 
 MsgBox "The path &amp; file name are: " &amp; strFullName 
 
End Sub 

```
