If the third shape on the first page in the active publication is a connector whose end is connected to a shape, this example stores the connection site number, stores a reference to the connected shape, and then disconnects the end of the connector from the shape.


```
Dim intSite As Integer 
Dim shpConnected As Shape 
 
With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(3) 
 
 ' Test whether shape is a connector. 
 If .Connector Then 
 With .ConnectorFormat 
 
 ' Test whether connector is connected to another shape. 
 If .End Connected Then 
 
 ' Store connection site number. 
 intSite = .EndConnectionSite 
 
 ' Set reference to connected shape. 
 Set shpConnected = .EndConnectedShape 
 
 ' Disconnect connector and shape. 
 .EndDisconnect 
 End If 
 End With 
 End If
