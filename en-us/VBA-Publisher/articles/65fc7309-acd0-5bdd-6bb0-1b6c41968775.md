## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **CustomDrop**( **_Drop_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CalloutFormat** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Drop|Required| **Variant**|The drop distance. Numeric values are evaluated in points; strings can be in any units supported by Microsoft Publisher (for example, "2.5 in").|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The drop distance is normally measured from the top of the text box. However, if the  ** [AutoAttach](893303d8-97fe-9eea-8d6e-d9110c75ee84.md)** property is set to **True** and the text box is to the left of the origin of the callout line (the place to which the callout points), the drop distance is measured from the bottom of the text box.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example sets the custom drop distance to 14 points, and specifies that the drop distance always be measured from the top. For the example to work, the third shape in the active publication must be a callout.


```
With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(3).Callout 
 .CustomDrop Drop:=14 
 .AutoAttach = False 
End With 

```
