 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Application** object.


### Return Value

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Turning screen updating off during run time can speed execution of Microsoft Visual Basic code. However, we recommend that you provide some indication of status so that the user is aware that the program is functioning correctly.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example turns off screen updating at the beginning of a subroutine and turns it back on at the end of the subroutine.


```
Sub TurnOffScreenUpdating() 
 ScreenUpdating = False 
 
 ' Execute code here. 
 
 ScreenUpdating = True 
End Sub 

```
