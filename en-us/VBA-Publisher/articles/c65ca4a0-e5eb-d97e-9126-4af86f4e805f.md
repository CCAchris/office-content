 _expression_. **DocumentUpdating**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **MailMerge** object.


### Return Value

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Turning document updating off during run time can speed execution of Microsoft Visual Basic code. However, we recommend that you provide some indication of status so that the user is aware that the program is functioning correctly.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example turns off document updating at the beginning of a mail merge subroutine and turns it back on at the end of the subroutine.


```
Sub MailMergeProcedure() 
 ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DocumentUpdating = False ' Mail merge code. 
ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DocumentUpdating = True 
End Sub 
 
```
