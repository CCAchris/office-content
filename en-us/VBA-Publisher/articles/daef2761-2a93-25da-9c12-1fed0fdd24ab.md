Returns or sets a  **PbInlineAlignment** constant that indicates whether an inline shape has left, right, or in-text alignment. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **InlineAlignment**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **InlineAlignment** property value can be one of the ** [PbInlineAlignment](923e19b1-3492-51ea-af79-52bdd99b232d.md)** constants declared in the Microsoft Publisher type library.

An automation error is returned if the shape is not already inline.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

```
Dim theShape As Shape 
Dim theRange As TextRange 
 
Set theRange = ActiveDocument.Pages(2).Shapes(1).TextFrame.TextRange 
Set theShape = ActiveDocument.Pages(2).Shapes(2) 
 
If Not theShape.IsInline = msoTrue Then 
 theShape.MoveIntoTextFlow Range:=theRange 
 theShape.InlineAlignment = pbInlineAlignmentRight 
End If
```
