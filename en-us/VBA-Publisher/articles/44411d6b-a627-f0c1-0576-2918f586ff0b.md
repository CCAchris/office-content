## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **MoveOutOfTextFlow**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

An automation error is returned if the shape to be moved is not already inline.

After the  **MoveOutOfTextFlow** method is called on an inline shape, the shape will maintain its position on the page, but it will no longer be inline.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example moves the first inline shape contained in a given text range out of the text flow.


```
Dim theShape As Shape 
 
Set theShape = ActiveDocument.Pages(2).Shapes(1) _ 
 .TextFrame.TextRange.InlineShapes(1) 
 
theShape.MoveOutOfTextFlow
```
