Indicates whether the specified shape has a  **TextFrame** object associated with it. Read-only.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **HasTextFrame**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Story** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If the  **HasTextFrame** property is true, clients must check the value of the **HasText** property of the **TextFrame** object to determine if there is any text on the shape.

The  **HasTextFrame** property value can be one of the **MsoTriState** constants declared in the Microsoft Office type library and shown in the following table.



|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **msoFalse**| The specified shape does not have a **TextFrame** object associated with it.|
| **msoTriStateMixed**| Indicates a combination of **msoTrue** and **msoFalse** for the specified shape range.|
| **msoTrue**| The specified shape has a **TextFrame** object associated with it.|

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example tests all the shapes in the selection and if none have text frames associated with them, they are left aligned.


```
Sub MoveLeft() 
 
 Dim shpAll As ShapeRange 
 
 Set shpAll = Application.ActiveDocument.Selection.ShapeRange 
 If shpAll.HasTextFrame = msoFalse Then 
 shpAll.Align msoAlignLefts, msoTrue 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
