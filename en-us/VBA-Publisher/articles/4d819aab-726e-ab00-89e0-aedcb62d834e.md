## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to handle the  **BeforePrint** event. It displays a message notifying the user that the document is about to be printed.


```
Private Sub pubApplication_BeforePrint(ByVal Doc As Document, Cancel As Boolean ) 
 MsgBox "Printing of " &amp; Doc.Name &amp; " is about to occur ." 
End Sub
```

For this event to occur, you must place the following line of code in the  **General Declarations** section of your module.




```
Private WithEvents pubApplication As Application
```

Then run the following initialization procedure.




```
Public Sub Initialize_pubApplication() 
 Set pubApplication = Publisher.Application 
End Sub
```
