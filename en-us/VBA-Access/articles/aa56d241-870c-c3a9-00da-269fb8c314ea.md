 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets the trendline order (an integer greater than 1) when the trendline type is  **xlPolynomial**. Read/write  **Long**.

## Example

This example sets the order of the first trendline for series one if it's polynomial.


```
With myChart.SeriesCollection(1).Trendlines(1) 
 If .Type = xlPolynomial Then .Order = 3 
End With
```
