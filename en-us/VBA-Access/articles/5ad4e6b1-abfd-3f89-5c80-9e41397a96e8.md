The following procedure compacts and repairs a database, creates a log if there is any corruption in the source file, and returns a  **Boolean** value based on whether the recovery was successful.




```
Function RepairDatabase(strSource As String, _ 
 strDestination As String) As Boolean 
 ' Input values: the paths and file names of 
 ' the source and destination files. 
 
 ' Trap for errors. 
 On Error GoTo error_handler 
 
 ' Compact and repair the database. Use the return value of 
 ' the CompactRepair method to determine if the file was 
 ' successfully compacted. 
 RepairDatabase = _ 
 Application.CompactRepair( _ 
 LogFile:=True, _ 
 SourceFile:=strSource, _ 
 DestinationFile:=strDestination) 
 
 ' Reset the error trap and exit the function. 
 On Error GoTo 0 
 Exit Function 
 
' Return False if an error occurs. 
error_handler: 
 RepairDatabase = False 
 
End Function
