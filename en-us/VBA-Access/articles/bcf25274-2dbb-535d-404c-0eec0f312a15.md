Returns or specifies the icon for a criterion in an icon set conditional formatting rule. Read/write


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Icon**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  ** [IconCriterion](3517d900-4d84-2ded-ccb1-a3d78d3f6c09.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

After you set the  **Icon** property for the icon criterion in an icon set conditional formatting rule, the ** [IconSet](8e0529d5-1c15-744e-2391-7229bcbcd043.md)** property is changed to **xlCustomSet**.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following code example creates an icon set conditional formatting rule that displays four icons split across the specified percentages. The icon set is initially set to use the  **4 Arrows (Colored)** icon set, but the **Icon** property is used to override which icons are used for the first and third criteria. After running the code, the icon for the first criterion is the **Red Cross** icon, the icon for the second criterion is the second arrow from the **4 Arrows (Colored)** icon set, the icon for the third criterion is the **Yellow Traffic Light** icon, and the icon for the fourth criterion is the fourth arrow from **4 Arrows (Colored)** icon set.
