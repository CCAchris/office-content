The  **RepaintObject** method carries out the RepaintObject action in Visual Basic.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **RepaintObject**( **_ObjectType_**,  **_ObjectName_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **DoCmd** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|ObjectType|Optional| **AcObjectType**|A  ** [AcObjectType](157a8d35-2b27-4f62-8e74-525043f6ec71.md)** constant that specifies the type of object to repaint.|
|ObjectName|Optional| **Variant**|A string expression that's the valid name of an object of the type selected by the objecttype argument.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

You can use the  **RepaintObject** method to complete any pending screen updates for a specified database object or for the active database object, if none is specified. Such updates include any pending recalculations for the object's controls.

Using the  **RepaintObject** method with no arguments (the default constant, **acDefault**, is assumed for the objecttype argument) repaints the active window.

The  **RepaintObject** method of the **DoCmd**object was added to provide backwards compatibility for running the  **RepaintObject** method in Visual Basic code in Microsoft Access 95. If you want to repaint a form, it's recommended that you use the existing **Repaint**method of the  **Form**object instead.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example repaints the table Customers:


```
DoCmd.RepaintObject acTable, "Customers"
```
