The  **CurrentUser** method returns a string that contains the name of the current user account.

If you haven't established a security-enabled workgroup, the  **CurrentUser** method returns the name of the default user account, Admin. The Admin user account gives the user full permissions to all database objects.

If you have enabled workgroup security, then the  **CurrentUser** method returns the name of the current user account. For user accounts other than Admin, you can specify permissions that restrict the users' access to database objects.
