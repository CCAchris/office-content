 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns a  ** [Workbooks](f768da57-013a-e652-0f5d-60b03aa4240a.md)** collection that represents all the open workbooks. Read-only.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Workbooks**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Using this property without an object qualifier is equivalent to using `Application.Workbooks`.

The collection returned by the  **Workbooks** property doesn't include open add-ins, which are a special kind of hidden workbook. You can, however, return a single open add-in if you know the file name. For example, `Workbooks("Oscar.xla")`will return the open add-in named "Oscar.xla" as a  **Workbook** object.


 **Note**  A workbook displayed in a protected view window is not a member of the  **Workbooks** collection. Instead, use the ** [Workbook](379b98f0-b177-7910-4968-ce4ed2f1ca9d.md)** property of the ** [ProtectedViewWindow](6a32240c-c90b-c51a-6f8e-c3ff496b9855.md)** object to access a workbook that is displayed in a protected view window.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example activates the workbook Book1.xls.


```
Workbooks("BOOK1").Activate
```

This example opens the workbook Large.xls.




```
Workbooks.Open filename:="LARGE.XLS"
```

This example saves changes to and closes all workbooks except the one that's running the example.




```
For Each w In Workbooks 
    If w.Name <> ThisWorkbook.Name Then 
        w.Close savechanges:=True 
    End If 
Next w
```
