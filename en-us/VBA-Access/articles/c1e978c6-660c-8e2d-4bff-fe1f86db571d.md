 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Gets or sets the tint that is applied to the theme color in the  **BackColor** property of the specified object. Read/write **Single**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **BackTint**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Section** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **BackTint** property contains a numeric expression that can be used to lighten the theme color in the **BackColor** property. The default value of the **BackTint** property is 100, which is neutral, and does not change the theme color. To lighten the color, first determine the percentage by which to lighten from 1 to 100, then subtract that value as a whole number from 100 and use the remainder. For example, to lighten the theme color tint by 75%, subtract 75 from 100 and use the remainder, which is 25.

This property is not surfaced in the property sheet.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following code example lightens  **BackColor** by 75%.


```
Me.ctl.BackTint=25
```
