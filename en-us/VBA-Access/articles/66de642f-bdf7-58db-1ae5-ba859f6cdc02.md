## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **BorderShade**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **SubForm** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **BorderShade** property contains a numeric expression that can be used to darken the theme color in the **BorderColor** property. The default value of the **BorderShade** property is 100, which is neutral, and does not change the theme color. To darken the color, first determine the percentage by which to darken from 1 to 100, then subtract that value as a whole number from 100 and use the remainder. For example, to darken the theme color by 75%, subtract 75 from 100 and use the remainder, which is 25.

This property is not surfaced in the property sheet.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following code example darkens  **BorderColor** by 75%.


```
Me.ctl.BorderShade=25
```
