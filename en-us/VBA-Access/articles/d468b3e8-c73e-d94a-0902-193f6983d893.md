# DialogSheetView Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the current  **Dialog** sheet view in a workbook.

## Remarks

To access this object, you must have a dialog sheet that was developed in the active workbook. Without the dialog sheet, the view properties for the object return an empty string value.


## Example

The following example turns on the dialog sheet view for the active workbook.


```
Worksheets("Sheet1").DialogSheetView.Visible = True
```
