 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Specifies whether the  **Close** button on a form is enabled. Read/write **Boolean**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **CloseButton**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Report** object.


## Remarks

The  **CloseButton** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Visual Basic**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Yes| **True**|(Default) The  **Close** button is enabled.|
|No| **False**|The  **Close** button is disabled and the **Close** command isn't available on the **Control** menu.|
You can set the  **CloseButton** property only in form Design view.

If you set the  **CloseButton** property to No, the **Close** button remains visible but appears dimmed (grayed), and you must provide some other way to close the form â€” for example, a command button or custom menu command that runs a macro or event procedure that closes the form.

You can also close the form by pressing ALT+F4.
