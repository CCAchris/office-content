# Use Aggregate Functions to Work with Values in Access SQL

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Access 2013_

Aggregate functions are used to calculate statistical and summary information from data in tables. These functions are used in  ** [SELECT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/A5C9DA94-5F9E-0FC0-767A-4117F38A5EF3%28Office.15%29.aspx)** statements, and all of them take fields or expressions as arguments.

To count the number of records in a result set, use the  ** [Count](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/01743D33-D7DE-12B5-EB0F-EB775B0BCFFD%28Office.15%29.aspx)** function. Using an asterisk with the **Count** function causes **Null** values to be counted as well.



```
SELECT Count(*) AS [Number of Invoices] 
    FROM tblInvoices 

```

To count only non- **Null** values, use the **Count** function with a field name.



```
SELECT Count(Amount) AS 
    [Number of Valid Invoice Amounts] 
    FROM tblInvoices 

```

To find the average value for a column or expression of numeric data, use the  ** [Avg](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/BE955493-A236-2DBE-A08D-2A7F6D113B39%28Office.15%29.aspx)** function.



```
SELECT Avg(Amount) AS [Average Invoice Amount] 
    FROM tblInvoices 

```

To find the total of the values in a column or expression of numeric data, use the  ** [Sum](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/02498420-F177-521C-EF81-E2F7EA02B231%28Office.15%29.aspx)** function.



```
SELECT Sum(Amount) AS [Total Invoice Amount] 
    FROM tblInvoices 

```

To find the minimum value for a column or expression, use the  ** [Min](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5AC77377-1F6A-7B4F-ECBB-5480BC5A3187%28Office.15%29.aspx)** function.



```
SELECT Min(Amount) AS [Minimum Invoice Amount] 
    FROM tblInvoices 

```

To find the maximum value for a column or expression, use the  ** [Max](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5AC77377-1F6A-7B4F-ECBB-5480BC5A3187%28Office.15%29.aspx)** function.



```
SELECT Max(Amount) AS [Maximum Invoice Amount] 
    FROM tblInvoices 

```

To find the first value in a column or expression, use the  ** [First](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/AED3BECD-61AF-DCAF-6205-7421F29C545C%28Office.15%29.aspx)** function.



```
SELECT First(Amount) AS [First Invoice Amount] 
    FROM tblInvoices 

```

To find the last value in a column or expression, use the  ** [Last](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/68AC1598-33EE-65E8-6875-5ACC6E7803BD%28Office.15%29.aspx)** function.



```
SELECT Last(Amount) AS [Last Invoice Amount]  
    FROM tblInvoices 

```
