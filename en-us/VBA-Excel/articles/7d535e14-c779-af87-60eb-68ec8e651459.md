## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If a procedure doesn't use the  **OnRepeat** method, the **Repeat** command repeats procedure that was run most recently.

The procedure must use the  **OnRepeat** and **OnUndo** methods last, to prevent the repeat and undo procedures from being overwritten by subsequent actions in the procedure.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example sets the repeat and undo procedures.


```
Application.OnRepeat "Repeat VB Procedure", _ 
 "Book1.xls!My_Repeat_Sub" 
Application.OnUndo "Undo VB Procedure", _ 
 "Book1.xls!My_Undo_Sub"
```
