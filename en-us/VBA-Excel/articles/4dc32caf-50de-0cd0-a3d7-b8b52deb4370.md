The following describes the results for previous and current property settings: 


- False (Microsoft Office2010 behavior): Any time can be specified; dates are precise points in time (midnight of the specified date). Filtering date ranges start or end at midnight.
    
- True (Microsoft Office 2013 behavior): This behavior is enforced for Timeline controls. Only whole dates are specified; dates include all times-of-day until and not including the next day at midnight.
    
For a Timeline, always returns  **True**; returns a run-time error when setting to this to  **False**.

For a non-date filter, any access returns a run-time error.
