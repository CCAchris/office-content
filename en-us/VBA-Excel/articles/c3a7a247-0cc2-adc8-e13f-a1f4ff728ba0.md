Returns or sets the transparent color for the specified picture as a red-green-blue (RGB) value. For this property to take effect, the  ** [TransparentBackground](9b7cc5b5-610a-821b-cf99-e2af5c4ecf61.md)**property must be set to  **True**. Applies to bitmaps only. Read/write  **Long**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **TransparencyColor**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **PictureFormat** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If you want to be able to see through the transparent parts of the picture all the way to the objects behind the picture, you must set the  **Visible** property of the picture's **FillFormat** object to **False**. If your picture has a transparent color and the  **Visible** property of the picture's **FillFormat** object is set to **True**, the picture's fill will be visible through the transparent color, but objects behind the picture will be obscured.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example sets the color that has the RGB value returned by the function RGB(0, 0, 255) as the transparent color for shape one on  `myDocument`. For the example to work, shape one must be a bitmap.


```
blueScreen = RGB(0, 0, 255) 
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
With myDocument.Shapes(1) 
 With .PictureFormat 
 .TransparentBackground = True 
 .TransparencyColor = blueScreen 
 End With 
 .Fill.Visible = False 
End With
```
