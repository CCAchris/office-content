|Procedure|Required| **String**|The name of the procedure to be run.|
|LatestTime|Optional| **Variant**|The latest time at which the procedure can be run. For example, if LatestTime is set toEarliestTime + 30 and Microsoft Excel is not in Ready, Copy, Cut, or Find mode atEarliestTime because another procedure is running, Microsoft Excel will wait 30 seconds for the first procedure to complete. If Microsoft Excel is not in Ready mode within 30 seconds, the procedure won't be run. If this argument is omitted, Microsoft Excel will wait until the procedure can be run.|
|Schedule|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to schedule a new OnTime procedure. **False** to clear a previously set procedure. The default value is **True**.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Use  `Now + TimeValue(time)` to schedule something to be run when a specific amount of time (counting from now) has elapsed. Use `TimeValue(time)` to schedule something to be run a specific time.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example runs my_Procedure 15 seconds from now.


```
Application.OnTime Now + TimeValue("00:00:15"), "my_Procedure"
```

This example runs my_Procedure at 5 P.M.




```
Application.OnTime TimeValue("17:00:00"), "my_Procedure"
```

This example cancels the  **OnTime** setting from the previous example.




```
Application.OnTime EarliestTime:=TimeValue("17:00:00"), _ 
 Procedure:="my_Procedure", Schedule:=False
```
