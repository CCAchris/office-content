 _expression_A variable that represents an  **AboveAverage** object.


## Remarks

When setting the priority, the value must be a positive integer between 1 and the total number of conditional formatting rules on the worksheet. The priority must be a unique value for all rules on the worksheet, so changing the priority for the specified conditional formatting rule may cause the priority value of the other rules on the worksheet to be shifted.
