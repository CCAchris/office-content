 [Syntax](#sectionSection1)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection2)


Returns the one-tailed probability-value of a z-test. For a given hypothesized population mean, Z_TEST returns the probability that the sample mean would be greater than the average of observations in the data set (array) â€” that is, the observed sample mean.

 _expression_. **Z_Test**( **_Arg1_**,  **_Arg2_**,  **_Arg3_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [WorksheetFunction](7b1d5639-363d-632c-2cf0-2232562646b6.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Arg1|Required| **Variant**|Array is the array or range of data against which to test the hypothesized population mean.|
|Arg2|Required| **Double**|The value to test.|
|Arg3|Optional| **Variant**|Sigma - The population (known) standard deviation. If omitted, the sample standard deviation is used.|

### Return Value

Double

- If array is empty, Z_TEST returns the #N/A error value.
    
- Z_TEST is calculated as follows when sigma is not omitted:

![](../images/Z_TEST_ZA10391000.jpg)where x is the sample mean AVERAGE(array); s is the sample standard deviation STDEV_S(array); and n is the number of observations in the sample COUNT(array). 
    
- Z_TEST represents the probability that the sample mean would be greater than the observed value AVERAGE(array), when the underlying population mean is Î¼ 0 . From the symmetry of the Normal distribution, if AVERAGE(array) < Î¼0 , Z_TEST will return a value greater than 0.5.
    
- The following Excel formula can be used to calculate the two-tailed probability that the sample mean would be further from Î¼ 0 (in either direction) than AVERAGE(array), when the underlying population mean is Î¼0 : =2 * MIN(Z_TEST(array,Î¼0 ,sigma), 1 - Z_TEST(array,Î¼0 ,sigma)).
