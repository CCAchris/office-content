Returns or sets the elevation of the 3-D chart view, in degrees. Read/write  **Long**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Elevation**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Chart** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The chart elevation is the height at which you view the chart, in degrees. The default is 15 for most chart types. The value of this property must be between -90 and 90, except for 3-D bar charts, where it must be between 0 and 44.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example sets the chart elevation of Chart1 to 34 degrees. The example should be run on a 3-D chart (the  **Elevation** property fails on 2-D charts).


```
Charts("Chart1").Elevation = 34
```
