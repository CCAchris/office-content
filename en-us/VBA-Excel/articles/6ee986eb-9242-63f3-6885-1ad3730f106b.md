 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns a  ** [Range](b8207778-0dcc-4570-1234-f130532cc8cd.md)** object that represents the next cell.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Previous**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Range** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If the object is a range, this property emulates pressing SHIFT+TAB; unlike the key combination, however, the property returns the previous cell without selecting it.

On a protected sheet, this property returns the previous unlocked cell. On an unprotected sheet, this property always returns the cell immediately to the left of the specified cell.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example selects the previous unlocked cell on Sheet1. If Sheet1 is unprotected, this is the cell immediately to the left of the active cell.


```
Worksheets("Sheet1").Activate 
ActiveCell.Previous.Select
```
