## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 _expression_. **Hidden**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **PivotField** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

 Returns **True** for hidden levels and **False** for visible (non-hidden) levels.

This property is applicable only to levels of OLAP hierarchies.

For relational data sources and OLAP attributes, this property is always  **False**. Trying to set it to  **True** for an attribute or a relational field will return a run-time error. It is not possible to set this property to **True** for a level if all other levels of the same hierarchy already have this setting set to **True**. At least one level of a hierarchy has to have this property set to  **False**. Attempting to do this will return a run-time error.
