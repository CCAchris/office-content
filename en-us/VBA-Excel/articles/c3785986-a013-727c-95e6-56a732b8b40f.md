# HasUpDownBars Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **True** if the specified line chart has up and down bars. Applies only to line charts. Read/write **Boolean**.

## Example

This example turns on up and down bars for chart group one and then sets their colors. The example should be run on a 2-D line chart containing two series that cross each other at one or more data points.


```
With myChart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasUpDownBars = True 
 .DownBars.Interior.ColorIndex = 3 
 .UpBars.Interior.ColorIndex = 5 
End With
```
