## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **LayoutSubtotalLocation**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CubeField** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

You can set this property for any PivotTable field in outline format; however, the formatting appears only if the specified field is a row field other than the innermost (lowest level) row field. For non- OLAP data sources, the value of this property doesn't change when the field is rearranged or when it is added to or from removed from the report.

The  ** [LayoutForm](a9077651-214f-6926-89fc-c29a1ff35682.md)**property determines whether the report appears in table format or in outline format.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example displays the state field in the first PivotTable report on the active worksheet in outline format, and it displays the subtotals at the top of the field.


```
With ActiveSheet.PivotTables("PivotTable1") _ 
 .PivotFields("state") 
 .LayoutForm = xlOutline 
 .LayoutSubtotalLocation = xlAtTop 
End With
```
