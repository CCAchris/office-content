The  **CountLarge** property is functionally the same as the ** [Count](080cbbe7-056f-b21c-9004-171a6acce664.md)** property, except that the **Count** property will generate an overflow error if the specified range has more than 2,147,483,647 cells (one less than 2048 columns). The **CountLarge** property, however, can handle ranges up to the maximum size for a worksheet, which is 17,179,869,184 cells.
