## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The  **CommitChanges** method sends a **COMMIT TRANSACTION** statement to the OLAP server, and clears all cells that were edited by entering a value, but will not clear formulas in value cells. This method generates a run-time error if it is executed on a PivotTable report based on a non-OLAP data source.
