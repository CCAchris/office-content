## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **CalculationVersion**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If the workbook was saved in an earlier version of Excel and if the workbook hasn't been fully recalculated, then this property returns 0.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example compares the version of Microsoft Excel with the version of Excel that the workbook was last calculated in. If the two version numbers are different, the example sets the  `blnFullCalc` variable to **True**.


```
If Application.CalculationVersion <> _ 
 Workbooks(1).CalculationVersion Then 
 blnFullCalc = True 
Else 
 blnFullCalc = False 
End If
```
