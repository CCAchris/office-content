## Syntax

 _expression_. **Reset**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CommandBarControl** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

Resetting a built-in control restores the actions originally intended for the control and resets each of the control's properties back to its original state. Resetting a built-in command bar removes custom controls and restores built-in controls.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

This example uses the value of user to adjust the command bars according to the user level. If user is "Level 1," the command bar named "Custom" is displayed. If user is any other value, the built-in Visual Basic command bar is reset to its default state and the command bar named "Custom" is disabled.


```
Set myBarControl = CommandBars("Custom").Controls(2) 
If user = "Level 1" Then 
    myBarControl.Visible = True  
Else 
    CommandBars("Visual Basic").Reset 
    myBarControl.Enabled = False  
End If
```
