## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 _expression_. **Picture**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CommandBarButton** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

When you change the image on a button, you will also want to use the  **Mask** property to set a mask image. The mask image determines which parts of the button image are transparent. Always set the mask after you have set the picture for a **CommandBarButton** object.


 **Note**  The images for the  **View Microsoft**_Application_ and **Insert**_Item_ buttons on the **Standard** toolbar in the Visual Basic Editor cannot be changed.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

The following example sets the image and mask of the first  **CommandBarButton** that the code returns. To make this work, create a mask image and a button image and substitute the paths in the sample with the paths to your images.


```
Sub ChangeButtonImage() 
    Dim picPicture As IPictureDisp 
    Dim picMask As IPictureDisp 
 
    Set picPicture = stdole.StdFunctions.LoadPicture( _ 
        "c:\images\picture.bmp") 
    Set picMask = stdole.StdFunctions.LoadPicture( _ 
        "c:\images\mask.bmp") 
 
    'Reference the first button on the first command bar 
    'using a With...End With block. 
    With Application.CommandBars.FindControl(msoControlButton) 
        'Change the button image. 
        .Picture = picPicture 
 
        'Use the second image to define the area of the 
        'button that should be transparent. 
        .Mask = picMask 
    End With 
End Sub
```

The following example gets the image and mask of the first  **CommandBarButton** that the code returns and outputs each of them to a file. To make this work, specify a path for the output files.




```
Sub GetButtonImageAndMask() 
    Dim picPicture As IPictureDisp 
    Dim picMask As IPictureDisp 
 
    With Application.CommandBars.FindControl(msoControlButton) 
        'Get the button image and mask of this CommandBarButton object. 
        Set picPicture = .Picture 
        Set picMask = .Mask 
    End With 
 
    'Save the button image and mask in a folder. 
    stdole.SavePicture picPicture, "c:\image.bmp" 
    stdole.SavePicture picMask, "c:\mask.bmp" 
End Sub 

```
