 **Note**  The use of CommandBars in some Microsoft Office applications has been superseded by the new ribbon component of the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface. For more information, search Help for the keyword "ribbon."


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 _expression_. **Context**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CommandBar** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

You can set the  **Context** property only for custom command bars. This property will fail if the application doesn't recognize the context string, or if the application doesn't support changing context strings programmatically.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

This example displays a message box containing the context string for the command bar named "Custom". This example works in Microsoft Word and other applications that support the  **Context** property.


```
Set myBar = CommandBars _ 
    .Add(Name:="Custom", Position:=msoBarTop, _ 
    Temporary:=True) 
With myBar 
    .Controls.Add Type:=msoControlButton, ID:=2 
    .Visible = True  
End With 
MsgBox (myBar.Context) 

```
