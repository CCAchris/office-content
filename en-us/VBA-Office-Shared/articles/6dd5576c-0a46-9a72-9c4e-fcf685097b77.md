## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 _expression_. **RowIndex**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CommandBar** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

Several command bars can share the same row index, and command bars with lower numbers are docked first. If two or more command bars share the same row index, the command bar most recently assigned will be displayed first in its group.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

This example adjusts the position of the command bar named "Custom" by moving it to the left 110 pixels more than the default, and it makes this command bar the first to be docked by changing its row index to  **msoBarRowFirst**.


```
Set myBar = CommandBars("Custom") 
With myBar 
    .RowIndex = msoBarRowFirst 
    .Left = 140 
End With
```
