## Remarks

This method is called when the signing process has completed. Allows a signature provider add-in the ability to add additional functionality to the add-in. For example, if you wanted to offer an archive service where a user could upload their signed document, you could use this method to initiate that process.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example, written in C#, shows the implementation of the  **NotifySignatureAdded** method in a custom signature provider project.


```
 public void NotifySignatureAdded(object parentWindow, SignatureSetup sigsetup, SignatureInfo siginfo) 
 { 
 using (Win32WindowFromOleWindow window = new Win32WindowFromOleWindow(parentWindow)) 
 { 
 MessageBox.Show(window, "Signature has been applied", "Signing Ceremony", MessageBoxButtons.OK); 
 } 
 } 

```


 **Note**  Signature providers are implemented exclusively in custom COM add-ins and cannot be implemented in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).
