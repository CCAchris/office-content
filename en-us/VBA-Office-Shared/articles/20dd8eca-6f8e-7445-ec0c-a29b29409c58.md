Gets or sets an object reference. Read/write.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Object**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **COMAddIn** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **Object** property is a read/write property in which any object reference can be stored. In this regard, it is similar to the general-purpose **Tag** property of certain ActiveX controls.

In some cases, the  **Object** property returns the object represented by the specified **COMAddIn** object; otherwise, it returns **Nothing** by default.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example returns the object represented by the COM add-in  **msodraa9.ShapeSelect**.


```
Dim objBaseObject As Object 
Set objBaseObject = _ 
 Application.COMAddIns.Item("msodraa9.ShapeSelect").Object
```
