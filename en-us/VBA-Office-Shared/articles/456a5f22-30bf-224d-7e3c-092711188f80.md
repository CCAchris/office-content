Resumes synchronization between the local copy and the server copy of a shared document.


 **Note**  Beginning with Microsoft Office 2010, this object or member has been deprecated and should not be used.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 _expression_. **Unsuspend**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Sync** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

Use the  **Unsuspend** method to resume document synchronization when the **Status** property returns **msoSyncStatusSuspended**.

Not all document synchronization problems raise trappable run-time errors. After performing an operation using the  **Sync** object, it's a good idea to check the **Status** property; if the **Status** property is **msoSyncStatusError**, check the  **ErrorType** property for additional information on the type of error that has occurred.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

The following example resumes document synchronization if it has been suspended.


```
    Dim objSync As Office.Sync 
    Set objSync = ActiveDocument.Sync 
    If objSync.Status = msoSyncStatusSuspended Then 
        objSync.Unsuspend 
        MsgBox "Synchronization resumed.", _ 
            vbInformation + vbOKOnly, "Sync Status" 
    End If 
    Set objSync = Nothing 

```
