Reloads a schema from a file.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 _expression_. **Reload**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **CustomXMLSchema** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

Typically, this method is used to update the location of the schema or to determine if the schema is still valid. It is also useful for reloading a schema that frequently changes. If this action is attempted on a schema in a collection that is already validated or tied to a data stream, then the operation is not performed and an error message is displayed.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

The following example specifies the location of the schema and then reloads it.


```
Dim objCustomXMLSchema As  CustomXMLSchema 
Dim strSchemaLocation As String 
' Set the location of the schema.. 
objCustomXMLSchema.Location = "c:\mySchema.xsd" 
 
' Reload the schema. 
objCustomXMLSchema.Reload 

```
