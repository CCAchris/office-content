 _expression_. **WorkspaceLastChangedBy**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Sync** object.

The following example checks for a conflict between the local and the server copies of the shared document and reports the name of the user who last saved changes to the server copy.


```
    Dim objSync As Office.Sync 
    Dim strStatus As String 
    Set objSync = ActiveDocument.Sync 
    If objSync.Status = msoSyncStatusConflict Then 
        strStatus = "The server copy has been changed." &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _ 
            "Changes have been made by: " &amp; _ 
            objSync.WorkspaceLastChangedBy 
        MsgBox strStatus, vbInformation + vbOKOnly, "Server Copy Changed" 
    End If 
    Set objSync = Nothing
