This example customizes a command bar button. First, the button properties are reset to their default state. Then various button properties are set. 


```
Dim cbButton As CommandBarButton 
Set cbButton = CommandBars("Custom").Controls(2) 
cbButton.Reset 
With cbButton 
    .BuiltInFace = True  
    .Caption = "Compute Total" 
    .DescriptionText = "This button computes the total of all purchases." 
    .Enabled = True  
    .TooltipText = "Click to compute total amount for all items in your cart." 
End With
