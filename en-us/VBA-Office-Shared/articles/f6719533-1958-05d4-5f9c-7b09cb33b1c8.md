Moves the keyboard focus to the specified  **CommandBarButton** control. If the button is disabled or isn't visible, this method will fail.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **SetFocus**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CommandBarButton** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The focus on the control is subtle. After you use this method, you will notice a three dimensional highlight on the control. Pressing the arrow keys will navigate in the toolbars, as if you had arrived at the control by pressing only keyboard controls.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

This example creates a command bar named "Custom" and adds a  **ComboBox** control and a **Button** control to it. The example then uses the **SetFocus** method to set the focus to the **ComboBox** control.


```
Set focusBar = CommandBars.Add(Name:="Custom") 
With CommandBars("Custom") 
    .Visible = True  
    .Position = msoBarTop 
End With 
 
Set testComboBox = CommandBars("Custom").Controls _ 
    .Add(Type:=msoControlComboBox, ID:=1) 
With testComboBox 
    .AddItem "First Item", 1 
    .AddItem "Second Item", 2 
End With 
Set testButton = CommandBars("Custom").Controls _ 
    .Add(Type:=msoControlButton) 
testButton.FaceId = 17 
' Set the focus to the combo box. 
testComboBox.SetFocus
```
