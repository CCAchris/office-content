Resetting a built-in control restores the actions originally intended for the control and resets each of the control's properties back to its original state. Resetting a built-in command bar removes custom controls and restores built-in controls.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

This example customizes a command bar combo box. First, the combo box is reset to its default state. Then two line items are added to the combo box and various properties are set. 


```
Set combo = CommandBars("Custom").Controls(2) 
combo.Reset 
With combo 
    .AddItem "First Item", 1 
    .AddItem "Second Item", 2 
    .DropDownLines = 3 
    .DropDownWidth = 75 
    .ListIndex = 0 
End With 

```
