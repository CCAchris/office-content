## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 _expression_. **ListIndex**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CommandBarComboBox** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>


 **Note**  This property fails when applied to controls other than list controls.

Setting the  **ListIndex** property causes the specified control to select the given item and execute the appropriate action in the application.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

This example uses the  **ListIndex** property to determine the correct subroutine to run, based on the selection in the combo box on the command bar named "My Custom Bar." Because the procedure uses **ListIndex**, the text in the combo box can be anything.


```
Sub processSelection() 
Dim userChoice As Long 
userChoice = CommandBars("My Custom Bar").Controls(1).ListIndex 
    Select Case userChoice 
        Case 1 
            chartcourse 
        Case 2 
            displaygraph 
        Case Else 
            MsgBox ("Invalid choice. Please choose again.") 
    End Select 
End Sub
```
