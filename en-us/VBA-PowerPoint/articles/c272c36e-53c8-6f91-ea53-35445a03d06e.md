The secondary section is 50 percent of the size of the primary pie. You must run the example on either a pie-of-pie chart or a bar-of-pie chart.

With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        With .Chart.ChartGroups(1)

            .SplitType = xlSplitByValue

            .SplitValue = 10

            .VaryByCategories = True

            .SecondPlotSize = 50
