## Example

This example assumes that the fist slide in the active presentation already contains two shapes attached by a connector named "Conn1To2." The code adds a rectangle and a connector to the first slide. The end of the new connector will be attached to the same connection site as the end of the connector named "Conn1To2," and the beginning of the new connector will be attached to connection site one on the new rectangle.


```
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes

    Set r3 = .AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 100, 420, 200, 100)

    .AddConnector(msoConnectorCurve, 0, 0, 10, 10) _

        .Name = "Conn1To3"

    With .Item("Conn1To2").ConnectorFormat

        endConnSite1 = .EndConnectionSite

        Set endConnShape1 = .EndConnectedShape

    End With

    With .Item("Conn1To3").ConnectorFormat

        .BeginConnect r3, 1

        .EndConnect endConnShape1, endConnSite1

    End With

End With
```
