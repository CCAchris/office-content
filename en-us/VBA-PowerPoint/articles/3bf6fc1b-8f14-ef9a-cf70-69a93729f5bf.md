Sets or returns the percentageof the duration over which a timing deceleration should take place. Read/write.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Decelerate**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Timing** object.


### Return Value

Single


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

For example, a value of 0.9 means that an deceleration should start at the default speed, and then start to slow down after the first ten percent of the animation. 


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example adds a shape and adds an animation that starts at the default speed and slows down after 70% of the animation has finished.


```
Sub AddShapeSetTiming()



    Dim effDiamond As Effect

    Dim shpRectangle As Shape



    'Adds rectangle and sets animation effect

    Set shpRectangle = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes _

        .AddShape(Type:=msoShapeRectangle, Left:=100, _

        Top:=100, Width:=50, Height:=50)

    Set effDiamond = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine _

        .MainSequence.AddEffect(Shape:=shpRectangle, _

        effectId:=msoAnimEffectPathDiamond)



    'Slows the effect after seventy percent of the animation has finished

    With effDiamond.Timing

        .Decelerate = 0.3

    End With



End Sub
```
