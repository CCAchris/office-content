(The ** [Presentation](9c05deb7-a385-540f-97a5-1c5510f120c6.md)**property of the  **SlideShowWindow** object or **DocumentWindow** object returns the presentation from which the window was created, not the embedded presentation.)


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

```
SlideShowWindows(1).View.Slide.Copy
```
