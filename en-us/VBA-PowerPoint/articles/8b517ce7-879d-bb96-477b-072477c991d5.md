Private Sub PPTApp_ColorSchemeChanged(ByVal SldRange As SlideRange)



    If SldRange.Count = 1 Then

        MsgBox "You've changed the color scheme for " _

            &amp; SldRange.Name &amp; "."

    Else

        MsgBox "You've changed the color scheme for " _

            &amp; SldRange.Count &amp; " slides."
