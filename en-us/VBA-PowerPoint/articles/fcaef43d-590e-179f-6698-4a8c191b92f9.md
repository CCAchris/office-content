## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example displays the type of object contained in shape one on slide one in the active presentation. Shape one must contain an OLE object.


```
MsgBox TypeName(ActivePresentation.Slides(1) _

    .Shapes(1).OLEFormat.Object)


```

This example displays the name of the application in which each embedded OLE object on slide one in the active presentation was created.




```
For Each s In ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes

    If s.Type = msoEmbeddedOLEObject Then

        MsgBox s.OLEFormat.Object.Application.Name

    End If

Next


```

This example adds text to cell A1 on worksheet one in the Microsoft Excel workbook contained in shape three on slide one in the active presentation.




```
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(3)

    .OLEFormat.Object.Worksheets(1).Range("A1").Value = "New text"

End With
```
