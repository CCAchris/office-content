The following example sets the label spacing of the category axis for the first chart in the active document to twice the current setting, if the offset is less than 500.




```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        With .Chart.Axes(xlCategory).TickLabels

            If .Offset < 500 then

                .Offset = .Offset * 2

            End If

        End With

    End If

End With
```
