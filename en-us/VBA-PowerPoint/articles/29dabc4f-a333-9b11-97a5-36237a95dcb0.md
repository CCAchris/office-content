 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Sets or returns whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations. Read/write.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Additive**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **AnimationBehavior** object.


### Return Value

MsoAnimAdditive


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The value of the  **Additive** property can be one of these **MsoAnimAdditive** constants.



|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **msoAnimAdditiveAddBase**|Does not combine current animation with other animations. The default.|
| **msoAnimAdditiveAddSum**| Combines the current animation with other running animations.|
Combining animation behaviors is particularly useful for rotation effects. For example, if the current animation changes rotation and another animation is also changing rotation, if this property is set to  **msoAnimAdditiveAddSum**, Microsoft PowerPoint adds together the rotations from both the animations.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example allows the current animation behavior to be added to another animation behavior.


```
Sub SetAdditive()



    Dim animBehavior As AnimationBehavior



    Set animBehavior = ActiveWindow.Selection.SlideRange(1) _

        .TimeLine.MainSequence(1).Behaviors(1)



    animBehavior.Additive = msoAnimAdditiveAddSum



End Sub
```
