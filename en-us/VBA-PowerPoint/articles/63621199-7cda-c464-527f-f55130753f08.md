 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns a presentation from a local computer to a server, and sets the local file to read-only so that it cannot be edited locally.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **CheckIn**( **_SaveChanges_**,  **_Comments_**,  **_MakePublic_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Presentation** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|SaveChanges|Optional| **Boolean**| **True** saves the presentation to the server location. The default value is **False**.|
|Comments|Optional| **Variant**|Comments for the revision of the presentation being checked in (only applies if SaveChanges equals  **True**).|
|MakePublic|Optional| **Variant**| **True** allows the user to perform a publish on the presentation after being checked in. This submits the document for the approval process, which can eventually result in a version of the presentation being published to users with read-only rights to the presentation (only applies if SaveChanges equals **True**).|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

To take advantage of the collaboration features built into Microsoft PowerPoint, presentations must be stored on a Microsoft Office SharePoint Portal Server.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example checks the server to see if the specified presentation can be checked in and, if so, closes the presentation and checks it back into server.


```
Sub CheckInPresentation(strPresentation As String)

    If Presentations(strPresentation).CanCheckIn = True Then

        Presentations(strPresentation).CheckIn

        MsgBox strPresentation &amp; " has been checked in."

    Else

        MsgBox strPresentation &amp; " cannot be checked in at this time.  Please try again later."

    End If

End Sub
```

To call the subroutine above, use the following subroutine and replace the " _http://servername/workspace/report.ppt_" file name with an actual file located on a server mentioned in the Remarks section above.




```
Sub CheckInPresentation()

    Call CheckInPresentation(strPresentation:= "http://servername/workspace/report.ppt")

End Sub
```
