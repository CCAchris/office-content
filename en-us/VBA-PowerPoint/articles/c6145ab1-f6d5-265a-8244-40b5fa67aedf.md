    Dim strFileName As String

    With Presentations

    If .CanCheckOut(strPresentation) = True Then

        .CheckOut FileName:=strPresentation

        .Open FileName:=strFileName

    Else

        MsgBox "You are unable to check out this " &amp; _

        "presentation at this time."

    End If

End Sub
```

To call the subroutine above, use the following subroutine and replace the  _"http://servername/workspace/report.ppt"_ file name for an actual file located on a server mentioned in the Remarks section above.




```
Sub CheckPPTOut()

    Call CheckOutPresentation(strPresentation:= _

        "http://servername/workspace/report.doc")
