|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|

### Return Value

## Remarks

Possible values for Flags are declared by the Visio type library in **VisCutCopyPasteCodes**, and are described in the following table.



|**Flag**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visCopyPasteNormal**|&amp;H0|Follow default copying behavior.|
| **visCopyPasteNoTranslate**|&amp;H1|Copy shapes to their original coordinate locations.|
| **visCopyPasteCenter**|&amp;H2|Copy shapes to the center of the page.|
| **visCopyPasteNoHealConnectors**|&amp;H4|Do not clean up connectors attached to cut shapes.|
| **visCopyPasteNoContainerMembers**|&amp;H8|Do not cut and copy unselected members of containers or lists.|
| **visCopyPasteNoAssociatedCallouts**|&amp;H16|Do not cut and copy unselected callouts associated with shapes.|
| **visCopyPasteDontAddToContainers**|&amp;H32|Do not add pasted shapes to any underlying containers.|
| **visCopyPasteNoCascade**|&amp;H64|Do not offset shapes on copy.|
Setting Flags to **visCopyPasteNormal** is the equivalent of the behavior in the user interface. You should use **visCopyPasteNormal** and the other flags consistently. For example, if you use the value **visCopyPasteNoTranslate** to copy, you should also use that value to paste, because that is the only way to ensure that shapes are pasted to their original coordinate location.
