# InvisibleApp.AfterModal Event (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Occurs after the Microsoft Visio instance leaves a modal state.


## Syntax

Private Sub  _expression__**AfterModal**( **_ByVal app As [IVAPPLICATION]_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **InvisibleApp** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|app|Required| **[IVAPPLICATION]**|The instance that is no longer modal.|

## Remarks

Visio becomes modal when it displays a dialog box. A modal instance of Visio does not handle Automation calls. The  **BeforeModal** event indicates that the instance is about to become modal, and the **AfterModal** event indicates that the instance is no longer modal.

If you're using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own  **Event** objects, use the **Add** or **AddAdvise** method. To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **Add** method as it applies to the **EventList** collection. To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **AddAdvise** method.
