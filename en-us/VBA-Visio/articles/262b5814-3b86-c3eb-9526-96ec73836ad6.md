# Shape.DistanceFromPoint Property (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Returns the distance from a shape to a point. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **DistanceFromPoint**( **_x_**,  **_y_**,  **_Flags_**,  **_[pvPathIndex]_**,  **_[pvCurveIndex]_**,  **_[pvt]_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|x|Required| **Double**|An x-coordinate.|
|y|Required| **Double**|A y-coordinate.|
|Flags|Required| **Integer**|Flags that influence the type of entries returned in results.|
|pvPathIndex|Optional| **Variant**|Identifies the point on the shape in conjunction with pvCurveIndex andpvt.|
|pvCurveIndex|Optional| **Variant**|Identifies the point on the shape in conjunction with pvPathIndex andpvt.|
|pvt|Optional| **Variant**|Identifies the point on the shape in conjunction with pvPathIndex andpvCurveIndex.|

### Return Value

Double


## Remarks

The (x,y) point is expressed in internal drawing units (inches in the drawing) with respect to the coordinate space defined by the sheet immediately containing ThisShape.

The pvPathIndex, pvCurveIndex, and pvt arguments optionally return values that identify the point the returned distance is measured from. Call that point (xOnThis,yOnThis). It lies along the c'th curve of ThisShape's p'th path and can be determined by:




```
ThisShape.Paths(*pvPathIndex).Item(*pvCurveIndex).Point(*pvt,&amp;xOnThis ,&amp;yOnthis)
```

You can use the  **PointAndDerivatives** method instead of the **Point** method if you want to find the first and second derivatives at position _t_ along the curve.

If pvPathIndex orpvCurveIndex is not **Null**, an  **Integer** (type VT_I4) is returned. Ifpvt isn't **Null**,  **DistanceFromPoint** returns a **Double** (type VT_R8).

The  **DistanceFromPoint** property considers guides to have extent and considers a shape's filled areas and paths.

The Flags argument can be any combination of the values of the constants defined in the following table. These constants are also defined in **VisSpatialRelationFlags** in the Microsoft Visio type library.



|**Constant **|**Value **|**Description **|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visSpatialIncludeDataGraphics**|&amp;H40|Includes data graphic callout shapes and their sub-shapes. By default, data graphic callout shapes and their subshapes are not included. If the parent shape is itself a data graphic callout, searches are made between the parent shape's geometry and non-callout shapes, unless this flag is set.|
| **visSpatialIncludeHidden**|&amp;H10 |Consider hidden Geometry sections. By default, hidden Geometry sections do not influence the result. |
| **visSpatialIgnoreVisible**|&amp;H20 |Do not consider visible Geometry sections. By default, visible Geometry sections influence the result. |
Use the NoShow cell to determine whether a Geometry section is hidden or visible. Hidden Geometry sections have a value of TRUE and visible Geometry sections have a value of FALSE in the NoShow cell.

If the parent object has no geometry, or if Flags excludes consideration of all geometry, the **DistanceFromPoint** property returns a large number (1E+30) which should be interpreted as infinite.

The  **DistanceFromPoint** property does not consider the width of a shape's line, shadows, line ends, control points, or connection points when computing its result.
