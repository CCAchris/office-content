Determines whether a progress indicator is shown while performing certain operations. Read/write.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ShowProgress**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If you want to perform an operation, such as printing, that typically displays a progress indicator but you don't want the progress indicator to appear, set the  **ShowProgress** property to **False** (0). By default, the **ShowProgress** property is **True** (non-zero).

In most cases you should restore the setting to its prior value when you've completed the operation.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **ShowProgress** property of the **Application** object. It switches the display of the progress indicator on and off and displays the state of the property in the Immediate window.


```
 
Sub ShowProgress_Example() 
 
 'Create a variable to hold the current state 
 'of the progress indicator. 
 Dim intProgress As Integer 
 
 'Display the current state of the progress indicator. 
 Debug.Print "Initial state: " &amp; Application.ShowProgress 
 
 'Get the state of the progress indicator. 
 intProgress = Application.ShowProgress 
 
 'Turn off the progress indicator. 
 Application.ShowProgress = False 
 
 'Display the status again. 
 Debug.Print "Changed state: " &amp; Application.ShowProgress 
 
 'Now restore the progress indicator to its original state. 
 Application.ShowProgress = intProgress 
 
 'Display the status again. 
 Debug.Print "Restored state: " &amp; Application.ShowProgress 
 
End Sub 

```
