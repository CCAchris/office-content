Determines whether a Microsoft Visio instance fires events. Read/write.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **EventsEnabled**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **InvisibleApp** object.


### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If the  **EventsEnabled** property is **False**, Visio does not fire events, run add-ons, or execute strings that contain arbitrary Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code when evaluating RUNADDON operands in cell formulas.

By default, the  **EventsEnabled** property is **True** when an instance of Visio starts.

You may want to disable event firing if you have written code to handle events such as  **DocumentOpened** or **DocumentCreated** that does not work properly, or to prevent the incorporation of a virus into a document. Events will not fire until the **EventsEnabled** property is set to **True**.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

These VBA macros show how to use the  **EventsEnabled** property to suspend and resume event processing.


```
 
Public Sub SuspendEventProcessing_Example() 
 
 'Suspend event processing. 
 Application.EventsEnabled = False 
 End Sub 
 
Public Sub EventsEnabled_Example() 
 
 'Resume event processing. 
 Application.EventsEnabled = True 
 
End Sub
```
