Copies a shape to the Clipboard.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Copy**( **_Flags_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Flags|Optional| **Variant**|Determines how shapes are translated during the copy operation.|

### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Possible values for Flags are declared by the Visio type library in **VisCutCopyPasteCodes**, and are described in the following table.



|**Flag**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visCopyPasteNormal**|&amp;H0|Follow default copying behavior.|
| **visCopyPasteNoTranslate**|&amp;H1|Copy shapes to their original coordinate locations.|
| **visCopyPasteCenter**|&amp;H2|Copy shapes to the center of the page.|
| **visCopyPasteNoHealConnectors**|&amp;H4|Do not clean up connectors attached to cut shapes.|
| **visCopyPasteNoContainerMembers**|&amp;H8|Do not cut and copy unselected members of containers or lists.|
| **visCopyPasteNoAssociatedCallouts**|&amp;H16|Do not cut and copy unselected callouts associated with shapes.|
| **visCopyPasteDontAddToContainers**|&amp;H32|Do not add pasted shapes to any underlying containers.|
| **visCopyPasteNoCascade**|&amp;H64|Do not offset shapes on copy.|
Setting Flags to **visCopyPasteNormal** is the equivalent of the behavior in the user interface. You should use **visCopyPasteNormal** and the other flags consistently. For example, if you use the value **visCopyPasteNoTranslate** to copy, you should also use that value to paste, because that is the only way to ensure that shapes are pasted to their original coordinate location.

To make a copy without using the Clipboard, use the  **Duplicate** method.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example shows how to use the  **Copy**method. It draws a rectangle and then copies it to the Clipboard.


```
 
Public Sub Copy_Example() 
 
 Dim vsoShape As Visio.Shape 
 
 Set vsoShape = ActivePage.DrawRectangle(1, 5, 5, 1) 
 
 'Copy the shape to the Clipboard. 
 vsoShape.Copy 
 
 End Sub 

```
