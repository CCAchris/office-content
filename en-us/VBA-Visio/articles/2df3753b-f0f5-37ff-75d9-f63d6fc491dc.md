## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **PointAndDerivatives**( **_t_**,  **_n_**,  **_x_**,  **_y_**,  **_dxdt_**,  **_dydt_**,  **_ddxdt_**,  **_ddydt_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Curve** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|t|Required| **Double**|The value in the curve's parameter domain to evaluate.|
|n|Required| **Integer**|0: get point; 1: point and 1st derivative; 2: point plus first and second derivative.|
|x|Required| **Double**|Returns x value of curve att.|
|y|Required| **Double**|Returns y value of curve att.|
|dxdt|Required| **Double**|Returns first derivative (dx/dt) at t ifn > 0.|
|dydt|Required| **Double**|Returns first derivative (dy/dt) at t ifn> 0.|
|ddxdt|Required| **Double**|Returns second derivative (ddx/dt) at t ifn> 1.|
|ddydt|Required| **Double**|Returns second derivative (ddy/dt) at t ifn> 1.|

### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Use the  **PointAndDerivatives** method of the **Curve** object to obtain the coordinates of a point within the curve's parameter domain and its first and second derivatives.

A  **Curve** object is described in terms of its parameter domain, which is the range [Start(),End()]. The **PointAndDerivatives** method can be used to extrapolate the curve's path outside [Start(),End()].


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro draws an oval on the document's active page and then retrieves it and iterates through its  **Paths** collection and each **Path** object to display the coordinates of various points along the curve. Because the shape drawn is an oval, it contains only one path and only one **Curve** object.
