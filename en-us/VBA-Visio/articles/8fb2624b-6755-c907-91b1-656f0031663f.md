# InvisibleApp.AppActivated Event (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Occurs after a Microsoft Visio instance becomes active.


## Syntax

Private Sub  _expression__**AppActivated**( **_ByVal app As [IVAPPLICATION]_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **InvisibleApp** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|app|Required| **[IVAPPLICATION]**|The instance of Visio that becomes the active application.|

## Remarks

The  **AppActivated** event indicates that an instance of Visio has become the active application on the Microsoft Windows desktop. The **AppActivated** event is different from the **AppObjectActivated** event, which occurs after an instance of Visio becomes activeâ€”the instance of Visio that is retrieved by the **GetObject** method in a Microsoft Visual Basic program.

If you're using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own  **Event** objects, use the **Add** or **AddAdvise** method. To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **Add** method as it applies to the **EventList** collection. To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **AddAdvise** method. To find an event code for the event you want to create, see [Event codes](de8f5c7a-421d-ebcf-22b6-4310a202ef64.md).
