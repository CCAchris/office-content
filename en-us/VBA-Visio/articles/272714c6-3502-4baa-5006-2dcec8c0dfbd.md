Public Sub GetWindowRect_Example() 
 
 Dim vsoApplication As Visio.Application 
 Dim vsoPZWindow As Visio.Window 
 Dim pinLeft As Long, pinTop As Long, pinWidth As Long, pinHeight As Long 
 
 Set vsoApplication = Visio.Application 
 
 'Display the Pan &amp; Zoom window 
 Set vsoPZWindow = vsoApplication.ActiveWindow.Windows.ItemFromID(visWinIDPanZoom) 
 vsoPZWindow.Visible = True 
 
 'Get the existing window size and position 
 vsoPZWindow.GetWindowRect pinLeft, pinTop, pinWidth, pinHeight 
 Debug.Print pinLeft, pinTop, pinWidth, pinHeight 
 
 'Change the window height and get the new values 
 vsoPZWindow.SetWindowRect pinLeft, pinTop, pinWidth, pinHeight + 50 
 vsoPZWindow.GetWindowRect pinLeft, pinTop, pinWidth, pinHeight 
 Debug.Print pinLeft, pinTop, pinWidth, pinHeight
