Visio 4.5 provided an undocumented  **Hyperlink** method for a **Document** object that had the following signature:




```
HRESULT FollowHyperlink[in] (BSTR Target, [in] BSTR Location);
```

Visio 5.0 and later still support this method but it has been renamed  **FollowHyperlink45**:




```
HRESULT FollowHyperlink45[in] (BSTR Target, [in] BSTR Location);
```

Use of  **FollowHyperlink45** is discouraged, howeverâ€”unless you are using version 4.5, use **FollowHyperlink** instead.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **FollowHyperlink** method to navigate to a site on the Internet and view the resulting Web page in a new browser window. It also shows how to navigate to the second page of the current document and to the first page of another document on your computer. Before running the macro, substitute the path and file name of a valid Visio document on your computer for<path\filename>. 


```
Public Sub FollowHyperlink_Example() 
 
 'Navigate to the Microsoft Web site and view the page in a new browser window. 
 ThisDocument.FollowHyperlink "http://www.microsoft.com", "", , , 1 
 
 'Navigate to the second page of the current document. 
 ThisDocument.FollowHyperlink "", "Page-2" 
 
 'Navigate to the first page of another document 
 ThisDocument.FollowHyperlink "<path\filename>", "Page-1" 
 
End Sub
```
