 **In this article**
 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Indicates whether an object is capable of containing persistent events in its  **EventList** collection. Read-only.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **PersistsEvents**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Row** object.


### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Every object that has an  **EventList** property also has a **PersistsEvents** property. To be persistable, an event's action code must be **visActCodeRunAddon**, but it must also be in the  **EventList** collection of an object whose **PersistsEvents** property is **True**. The only objects that currently persist events are  **Document**,  **Master**, and  **Page** objects.

Whether a persistable event actually does persist depends on the value of its  **Persistent** property.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **PersistsEvents** property to determine if an object is capable of containing persistent events. Executing the macro prints 1 ( **True**), 1 ( **True**), and 0 ( **False**) in the  **Immediate** window for the **Document**,  **Page**, and  **Window** objects, respectively.


```
 
Public Sub PersistsEvents_Example() 
 
 Dim vsoDocument As Visio.Document 
 
 Set vsoDocument = Documents.Add("") 
 Debug.Print vsoDocument.PersistsEvents 
 Debug.Print ActivePage.PersistsEvents 
 Debug.Print ActiveWindow.PersistsEvents 
 
End Sub 

```
