Saves the current Web page settings to the registry.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **SaveSettings**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  ** [VisWebPageSettings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c4675de8-0f63-179f-f687-8962d54d6b2f%28Office.15%29.aspx)** object.


### Return Value

 **Nothing**


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

By default, when some Web page settings are explicitly set to something other than the default value, they are saved to the registry when a Save as Web Page project's files are exported to the target path. The  **SaveSettings** method causes these settings to be written to the registry when the method is called rather than waiting until the files are exported.

For more information about which settings are persisted to the registry, see  [Persisting Save as Web Page Settings](3646a841-f99c-2906-856b-0fd5a642d499.md).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example shows how to use the  **SaveSettings** method to immediately change the default value for the ** [PriFormat](84c7c085-0f12-f25d-bf17-646cc8b7cd97.md)** property.

Before running this example, replace  _path\filename_ with a valid path and file name for the Web page project files.
