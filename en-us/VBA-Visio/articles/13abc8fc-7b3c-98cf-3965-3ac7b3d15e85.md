# Master.Drop Method (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Creates one or more new  **Shape**objects by dropping an object onto a receiving object such as a master, drawing page, shape, or group.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Drop**( **_ObjectToDrop_**,  **_xPos_**,  **_yPos_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Master** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|ObjectToDrop|Required| **[UNKNOWN]**|The object or selection to drop. While this is typically a Visio object such as a  **Master**,  **Shape**, or  **Selection** object, it can be any OLE object that provides an **IDataObject** interface.|
|xPos|Required| **Double**|The x-coordinate at which to place the center of the shape's width or PinX.|
|yPos|Required| **Double**|The y-coordinate at which to place the center of the shape's height or PinY.|

### Return Value

Shape


## Remarks

Using the  **Drop** method is similar to moving a shape with the mouse. The object dropped (ObjectToDrop) can be a master or a shape on the drawing page.

To add a shape to a group or on a drawing page, apply the  **Drop** method to a **Shape** or **Page** object, respectively. The center of the shape's width-height box is positioned at the specified coordinates, and a **Shape** object that represents the shape that is created is returned. When applying this method to a **Shape** object, make sure that the **Shape** object represents a group.

If ObjectToDrop is a **Master**, the pin of the master is dropped at the specified coordinates. A master's pin is often, but not necessarily, at its center of rotation.
