 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Creates a new  **Master** object by dropping an object onto a receiving object such as a stencil or document, or the **Masters** or **MasterShortcuts** collection.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Drop**( **_ObjectToDrop_**,  **_xPos_**,  **_yPos_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Document** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|ObjectToDrop|Required| **[UNKNOWN]**|The object to drop. While this is typically a Visio object such as a  **Master**,  **Shape**, or  **Selection** object, it can be any OLE object that provides an **IDataObject** interface.|
|xPos|Required| **Integer**|The x-coordinate at which to place the center of the shape's width or PinX.|
|yPos|Required| **Integer**|The y-coordinate at which to place the center of the shape's height or PinY.|

### Return Value

Master


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Using the  **Drop** method is similar to moving a shape with the mouse. The object dropped (ObjectToDrop) can be a master or a shape on the drawing page.

If ObjectToDrop is a **Master**, the pin of the master is dropped at the specified coordinates. A master's pin is often, but not necessarily, at its center of rotation.

To create a new master in a stencil, apply the  **Drop** method to a **Document** object that represents a stencil (the stencil must be opened as an original or a copy rather than read-only). In this case, thexPos andyPos arguments are ignored, and the new master that is created is returned.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example shows how to use the  **Drop** method to create a master by dropping a shape onto a **Document** object.


```
 
Public Sub Drop_Example() 
 
    Dim vsoShape As Visio.Shape  
    Dim vsoMaster As Visio.Master  
 
    Set vsoShape = ActivePage.DrawRectangle(1, 2, 2, 1)  
 
    'Create a master in the document.  
    'The master appears on the document stencil.  
    Set vsoMaster = ActiveDocument.Drop(vsoShape,  0, 0)  
 
End Sub   

```
