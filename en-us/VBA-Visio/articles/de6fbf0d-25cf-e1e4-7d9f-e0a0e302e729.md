|app|Required| **[IVAPPLICATION]**|The instance of Visio that is forced to flush its event queue.|

This event, along with the  **MustFlushScopeBeginning** event, can be used to identify whether an event is being fired because Visio is forced to flush its event queue.

If you're using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own  **Event** objects, use the **Add** or **AddAdvise** method. To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **Add** method as it applies to the **EventList** collection. To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **AddAdvise** method. To find an event code for the event you want to create, see [Event codes](de8f5c7a-421d-ebcf-22b6-4310a202ef64.md).
