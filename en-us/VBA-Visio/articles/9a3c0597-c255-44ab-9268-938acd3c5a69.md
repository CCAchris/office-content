Moves a shape so that its pin is positioned at the coordinates represented by xPos andyPos. .


## Syntax

 _expression_. **SetCenter**( **_xPos_**,  **_yPos_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|xPos|Required| **Double**|The new x-coordinate of the center of rotation (PinX).|
|yPos|Required| **Double**|The new y-coordinate of the center of rotation (PinY).|

### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks

The coordinates represented by the xPos andyPos arguments are parent coordinates, measured from the origin of the shape's parent (the page or group that contains the shape).

The  **SetCenter** method only moves the point, in parent coordinates, about which the shape rotates. It does not change the point, in local coordinates, about which the shape rotates. The overall effect is to move the shape with respect to its parent shape (or the page).
