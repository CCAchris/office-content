## Remarks

The  **Units** property can be used to determine the unit of measure currently associated with a cell's value. The various unit codes are declared by the Visio type library in member ** [VisUnitCodes ](fce91c1b-d5c2-6522-2446-0b8f6cacbc84.md)**. For example, a cell's width might be expressed in inches ( **visInches**) or in centimeters ( **visCentimeters**). In some cases, a program might behave differently depending on whether a cell's value is in metric or in imperial units.

For a list of valid unit codes, see  [About Units of Measure](b6140312-b8e6-0cf2-9fe0-b14e800216bf.md).
