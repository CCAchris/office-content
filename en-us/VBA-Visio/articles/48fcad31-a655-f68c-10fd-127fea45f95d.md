 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **In this article**
 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns a point at a position along a curve.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Point**( **_t_**,  **_x_**,  **_y_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Curve** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|t|Required| **Double**|The value in the curve's parameter domain to evaluate.|
|x|Required| **Double**|Returns x value of curve att.|
|y|Required| **Double**|Returns y value of curve att.|

### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

A  **Curve** object is described in terms of its parameter domain, which is the range [Start(),End()]. The **Point** method of a **Curve** object returns thex,y coordinates at positiont, which is any position along the curve's path. The  **Point** method can be used to extrapolate the curve's path outside [Start(),End()].


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro draws a circle (a special case of an oval) on the document's active page. Then it iterates through the  **Paths** collection of the circle and each **Path** object to display the coordinates of various points along the curve. Because the shape drawn is a circle, it is a **Curve** object that has only one path.
