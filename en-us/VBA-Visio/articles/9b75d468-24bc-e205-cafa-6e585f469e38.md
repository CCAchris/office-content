 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Document** object.


### Parameters

|MakePublic|Optional| **Boolean**| **True** to publish the document after check-in. This submits the document for the approval process or, if there is no approval routing for the document, a public version is created that is available to readers of the folder (applies only if _SaveChanges_ equals **True**);  **False** leaves the document available only for private viewing. The default is **False**.|

### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

To check in a file, it must be stored in a document library on a computer running Microsoft SharePoint Server or Microsoft SharePoint Foundation.

After the document has been checked in using the  **CheckIn** method, the document is closed. This behavior is different from the user interface; when you check in a document in the user interface, the document is closed and re-opened as read-only.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example checks the server to see if the specified document can be checked in. If it can, this example saves and closes the document, and then checks it back into the server.


```
Sub CheckDocIn(varDocCheckIn As Variant) 
  
    If Documents.Item(varDocCheckIn).CanCheckin = True Then  
        Documents.Item(varDocCheckIn).CheckIn  
        MsgBox varDocCheckIn &amp; " has been checked in."  
    Else  
        MsgBox "This file cannot be checked in " _  
            &amp; "at this time. Please try again later."  
    End If   
  
End Sub
```

To call the preceding  **CheckDocIn** subroutine, use the following subroutine and replace _servername/workspace/drawing.vdx_ with the path to and name of an actual file located on a Microsoft SharePoint Server computer.




```
Sub DocIn()  
 
    Call CheckDocIn _  
        (varDocCheckIn:="http://servername/workspace/drawing.vdx") 
  
End Sub
```
