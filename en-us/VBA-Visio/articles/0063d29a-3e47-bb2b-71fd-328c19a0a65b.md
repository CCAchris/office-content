Trims selected shapes into smaller shapes.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Trim**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Selection** object.


### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Calling the  **Trim** method is equivalent to clicking **Trim** in the Microsoft Visio user interface (click **Operations** in the **Shape Design** group on the [Developer](1bdc55f5-8fc7-7257-03d5-c049eceb29ff.md) tab).

The new shapes inherit the formatting of the first selected shape, have no text, and are the topmost shapes in their containerâ€”the nth shape, nth - 1 shape, nth - 2 shape, and so forth in the  **Shapes** collection of their containing shape, wheren = count. The original shapes are deleted and no shapes are selected when the operation is complete.

The  **Trim** method is similar to the **Fragment** method but differs in the following ways:




- Shapes produced by the  **Trim** method coincide with the distinct paths of the selected shapes, taking overlap into account.
    
- Shapes produced by the  **Fragment** method coincide with the distinct regions of the selected shapes, also taking overlap into account.
    



## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **Trim** method to trim selected shapes into smaller shapes along their intersections.


```
Public Sub Trim_Example() 
 
 Dim vsoShape1 As Visio.Shape 
 Dim vsoShape2 As Visio.Shape 
 Dim shapeCount As Integer 
 
 'Draw two shapes that intersect 
 Set vsoShape1 = ActivePage.DrawRectangle(1, 4, 4, 1) 
 Set vsoShape2 = ActivePage.DrawOval(2, 6, 3, 2) 
 
 'Deselect the oval and then select both of the new shapes on the page 
 ActiveWindow.DeselectAll 
 ActiveWindow.SelectAll 
 
 'Create a selection object and assign the selected shapes to it 
 Dim vsoSelection As Visio.Selection 
 Set vsoSelection = ActiveWindow.Selection 
 
 'Trim the selected shapes 
 vsoSelection.Trim 
 
 'Move one of the newly created shapes 
 ActiveWindow.DeselectAll 
 shapeCount = ActivePage.Shapes.Count 
 
 Set vsoShape1 = ActivePage.Shapes(shapeCount - 2) 
 ActiveWindow.Select vsoShape1, visSelect 
 ActiveWindow.Selection.Move 2, 2 
 
End Sub
```
