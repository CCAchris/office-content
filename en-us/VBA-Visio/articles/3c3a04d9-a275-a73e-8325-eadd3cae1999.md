# Selection.DrawRegion Method (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Draws a new shape that represents the region containing a given point.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **DrawRegion**( **_Tolerance_**,  **_Flags_**,  **_x_**,  **_y_**,  **_ResultsMaster_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Selection** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Tolerance|Required| **Double**|Error tolerance when determining the coincidence of points. A distance expressed in internal units in the coordinate space of the  **Selection** object's containing shape; the maximum gap between paths that is tolerated when constructing the boundaries of a region.|
|Flags|Required| **Integer**|A constant or integer that specifies how to draw the region.|
|x|Optional| **Variant**|x-coordinate in internal units in the coordinate space of the  **Selection** object.|
|y|Optional| **Variant**|y-coordinate in internal units in the coordinate space of the  **Selection** object.|
|ResultsMaster|Optional| **Variant**|The  **Master** object which the new **Shape** object should be an instance of.|

### Return Value

Shape


## Remarks

The  **DrawRegion** method creates a new **Shape** object from pieces of the paths in the **Selection** object.




- If both x andy are specified, the resulting shape is the smallest region that contains the point (x,y).
    
- In the absence of either x ory, or if the point (x,y) is not contained in any region enclosed by the paths of the selected shapes, the result is the union of all the shapes that would have been created by using the  **Fragment** operation.
    
- If no closed region is defined by the selected shapes, the  **DrawRegion** method returns **Nothing** and raises no exception.
    


The Flags argument can be one or a combination of the following constants declared by the Visio type library in **VisDrawRegionFlags** .



|**Name **|**Value **|**Description **|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visDrawRegionDeleteInput**|&amp;H4 |Delete items in selection. |
| **visDrawRegionIgnoreVisible**|&amp;H20 |Exclude visible geometry. |
| **visDrawRegionIncludeDataGraphics**|&amp;H40|Include data graphic callout shapes and their sub-shapes. |
| **visDrawRegionIncludeHidden**|&amp;H10 |Include hidden geometry. |
If the  **DrawRegion** method is passed aResultsMaster of type VT_EMPTY or VT_ERROR (which is how VBA passes an unspecified optional argument), the new shape is not an instance of a master and the fill, line, and text styles of the new region are set to the document's default styles.

If the  **DrawRegion** method is passed a reference to a **Master** object inResultsMaster (type VT_UNKNOWN or VT_DISPATCH), the **DrawRegion** method instances that **Master** object and adds geometry computed given the **Selection** object.

The new  **Shape** object has no text other than text already inResultsMaster.
