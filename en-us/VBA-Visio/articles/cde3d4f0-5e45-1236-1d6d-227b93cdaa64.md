## Syntax

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Viewer** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|

|ShapeIndex|Required| **Long**|The index of the shape in the collection of shapes.|

### Return Value

String


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The collection of shapes is one-based, so the index of the first shape in the collection is 1. If there are no shapes in the drawing, or if you pass the index of a nonexistent shape, the  **ShapeName** property returns nothing.

The  **ShapeName** property returns the local name of the shape, not its universal name.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

The following code gets the names of all the shapes in the drawing that is open in Visio Viewer.


```
Dim intCounter As Integer

    For intCounter = 1 To Viewer1.ShapeCount

    Debug.Print Viewer1.ShapeName(intCounter)

Next intCounter
```
