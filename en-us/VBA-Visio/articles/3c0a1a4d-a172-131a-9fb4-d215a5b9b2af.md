 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Rotates selected shapes either as a group or individually about their pins.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Rotate**( **_Angle_**,  **_AngleUnitsNameOrCode_**,  **_BlastGuards_**,  **_RotationType_**,  **_PinX_**,  **_PinY_**,  **_PinUnitsNameOrCode_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Selection** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Angle|Required| **Double**|Specifies the angle to rotate the selection. See Remarks for possible values.|
|AngleUnitsNameOrCode|Optional| **Variant**|Specifies the units to use for Angle. See Remarks for possible values. The default is degrees.|
|BlastGuards|Optional| **Boolean**| **True** to override formulas in the ShapeSheet of any of the selected shapes to which the GUARD function has been applied; **False** to leave guarded formulas unchanged. The default is **False**. |
|RotationType|Optional| **VisRotationTypes**|Specifes how the selection is to be rotated. See Remarks for possible values.|
|PinX|Optional| **Double**|When RotationType is **visRotateSelectionWithPin**, specifies the X-position of the pin about which the selection is to be rotated.|
|PinY|Optional| **Double**| WhenRotationType is **visRotateSelectionWithPin**, specifies the Y-position of the pin about which the selection is to be rotated.|
|PinUnitsNameOrCode|Optional| **Variant**|Specifies the units to use for PinX andPinY. See Remarks for possible values. The default is inches.|

### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The following possible values for RotationType are declared in **VisRotationTypes** in the Visio type library.



|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visRotateSelectionWithPin**|1|Rotates the selection around a pin.|
| **visRotateSelection**|0|Rotates the selection relative to the center of the selection.|
| **visRotateShapes**|2|Rotates the selected shapes around their pins relative to their current angle.|
Passing  **True** for the optionalBlastGuards argument overrides formulas in the ShapeSheet of any of the selected shapes to which the GUARD function has been applied.

The default value for RotationType is **visRotateSelection** .

You can specify AngleUnitsNameOrCode orPinUnitsNameOrCode as an integer (a member of ** [VisUnitCodes](fce91c1b-d5c2-6522-2446-0b8f6cacbc84.md)**) or a string value such as "radians" or "inches". If the string is invalid or the unit code is inappropriate (nontextual), an error is generated.

For a complete list of valid unit strings along with corresponding Automation constants (integer values), see  [About units of measure](b6140312-b8e6-0cf2-9fe0-b14e800216bf.md).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **Rotate** method to rotate a selection 45 degrees relative to the center of the selection.


```
Public Sub Rotate_Example() 
 
 Dim vsoShape1 As Visio.Shape 
 Dim vsoShape2 As Visio.Shape 
 
 Set vsoShape1 = Application.ActiveWindow.Page.DrawRectangle(1, 9, 3, 7) 
 Set vsoShape2 = Application.ActiveWindow.Page.DrawRectangle(3, 6, 5, 5) 
 
 ActiveWindow.DeselectAll 
 
 ActiveWindow.Select vsoShape1, visSelect 
 ActiveWindow.Select vsoShape2, visSelect 
 
 Application.ActiveWindow.Selection.Rotate 45, visDegrees 
 
End Sub 

```
