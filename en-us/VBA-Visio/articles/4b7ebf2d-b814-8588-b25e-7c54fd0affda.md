The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **EndPage** property to save a range of pages in a drawing (in this case, from page 2 to page 3) as a Web page instead of the complete drawing.

This macro assumes that the current Visio drawing contains at least three pages.

Before running this macro, replace  _path\filename.htm_ with a valid target path on your computer and the filename that you want to assign to your Web page.




```
Public Sub EndPage_Example() 
 Dim vsoSaveAsWeb As VisSaveAsWeb 
 Dim vsoWebSettings As VisWebPageSettings 
 
 Set vsoSaveAsWeb = Visio.Application.SaveAsWebObject 
 Set vsoWebSettings = vsoSaveAsWeb.WebPageSettings 
 
 With vsoWebSettings 
 .StartPage = 2 
 .EndPage = 3 
 .TargetPath = "path\filename.htm" 
 End With 
 
 vsoSaveAsWeb.CreatePages 
End Sub
