## Remarks

 **Note**  Starting with Visio, the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface (UI) replaces the previous system of layered menus, toolbars, and task panes. VBA objects and members that you used to customize the user interface in previous versions of Visio are still available in Visio, but they function differently.

The file can be loaded into the application by using the  **LoadFromFile** method of a **UIObject** object.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to save a custom user interface file (.vsu). It does not manipulate any Visio menus or menu items. Before running this macro, change path to the location where you want to save the file, and changefilename to the name you'd like to assign the file.


```
 
Public Sub SaveMenusToFile_Example() 
 
 Dim vsoUIObject As Visio.UIObject 
 Dim strPath As String 
 
 'Get the Menus object from Visio. 
 Set vsoUIObject = Visio.Application.BuiltInMenus 
 
 'Save the Menus object to a file. 
 strPath = "path\filename.vsu" 
 vsoUIObject.SaveToFile (strPath) 
 MsgBox ("Menus successfully saved to " &amp; strPath) 
 
End Sub 

```
