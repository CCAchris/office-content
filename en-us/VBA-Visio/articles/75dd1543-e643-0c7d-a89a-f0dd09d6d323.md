## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 _expression_. **LinkToData**( **_DataRecordsetID_**,  **_RowID_**,  **_AutoApplyDataGraphics_**)

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Shape** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|DataRecordsetID|Required| **Long**|The ID of the data recordset containing the data to link to.|
|RowID|Required| **Long**|The ID of the row in the data recordset containing the particular data record to link to. |
|AutoApplyDataGraphics|Optional| **Boolean**|Whether to automatically apply a data graphic to the linked shapes. See Remarks for more information.|

### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The  **Shape.LinkToData** method functions much like the same method of the **Selection** object, ** [Selection.LinkToData](1aa42548-2f3a-015d-e618-c0e103ffaea3.md)**, except that it links a single shape, instead of a selection of shapes, to a single data row. 

If you pass  **True** for the AutoApplyDataGraphics parameter, Microsoft Visio re-applies the existing data graphic to a shape if it already had a data graphic applied before you called the method. For a shape that previously had no data graphic, Visio applies the data graphic most recently applied to any other shape in the current document.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **LinkToData** method to link a shape to a data row.

Before running this macro, add at least one data recordset to the  ** [DataRecordsets](edf6d0dc-2f16-eee0-fd4c-ec4c9409179e.md)** collection of the document. The macro uses the ID of the data recordset most recently added to the collection. It draws a rectangle shape on the page and links it to the data in the first row of the data recordset, while applying the default data graphic to the shape.




```
Public Sub LinkToData_Example() 
 
    Dim vsoDataRecordset As Visio.DataRecordset 
    Dim vsoShape As Visio.Shape 
    Dim intCount As Integer 
     
    intCount = Visio.ActiveDocument.DataRecordsets.Count 
    Set vsoDataRecordset = Visio.ActiveDocument.DataRecordsets(intCount) 
     
    Set vsoShape = ActivePage.DrawRectangle(2, 2, 5, 5) 
     
    vsoShape.LinkToData vsoDataRecordset.ID, 1, True 
 
End Sub
```
