# Window.MergePosition Property (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Specifies the left-to-right tab position of a merged anchored window. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **MergePosition**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Window** object.


### Return Value

Long


## Remarks

If there are  _n_ tabs, the leftmost position is 1 and the rightmost position is _n_. If the windows are merged in a docked stencil fashion, 1 is the topmost and  _n_ is the bottommost. A value of zero (0) means that the window is not merged.

The  **MergePosition** property applies only to anchored windows. If the **Window** object is an MDI frame window, Microsoft Visio raises an exception.

Use the  **Type** property to determine window type.
