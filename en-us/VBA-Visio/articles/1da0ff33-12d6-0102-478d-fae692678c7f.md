## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **SRC**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Viewer** object.


### Return Value

String


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

To produce a viable diagram in Visio Viewer, the source file must be a Visio drawing file (.vsd or .vdx). The file path may be to a URL as well as to a local or networked file.

If the source file is a multipage document, Visio Viewer displays the page that was active the last time the file was saved in Visio, assuming that the file was not subsequently modified outside of Visio. In that case, Visio Viewer displays either the last active page or the first valid page.

If there is no document loaded in Visio Viewer, the  **SRC** property returns a null string (nothing).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following code sets a typical path to a source file in Visio Viewer.


```
vsoViewer.SRC = "C:\users\Visio User\My Visio Drawing.vsd"
```
