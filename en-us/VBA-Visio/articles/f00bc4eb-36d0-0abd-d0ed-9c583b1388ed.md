 _expression_A variable that represents a  **MasterShortcuts** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|ObjectToDrop|Required| **[UNKNOWN]**|The object to drop. While this is typically a Visio object such as a  **Master**,  **Shape**, or  **Selection** object, it can be any OLE object that provides an **IDataObject** interface.|
|xPos|Required| **Integer**|The x-coordinate at which to place the center of the shape's width or PinX.|
|yPos|Required| **Integer**|The y-coordinate at which to place the center of the shape's height or PinY.|

### Return Value

Master


## Remarks

Using the  **Drop** method is similar to moving a shape with the mouse. The object dropped (ObjectToDrop) can be a master or a shape on the drawing page.

If ObjectToDrop is a **Master**, the pin of the master is dropped at the specified coordinates. A master's pin is often, but not necessarily, at its center of rotation.
