## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Load**( **_UrlOrFilename_**)

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Viewer** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|UrlOrFilename|Required| **String**|The full path and file name or the URL of the file to be loaded.|

### Return Value

Boolean


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If the load succeeds, the  **Load** method returns **True**. The method returns  **False** if the load fails.

To produce a viable diagram in Visio Viewer, the source file loaded must be a Visio drawing file (.vsd or .vdx). The file path may be to a URL as well as to a local or networked file.

If the source file is a multipage document, Visio Viewer displays the page that was active the last time the file was saved in Visio, assuming that the file was not subsequently modified outside of Visio. In that case, Visio Viewer displays either the last active page or the first valid page.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following code loads a drawing named "Shapes.vsd" from the local drive into Visio Viewer and returns whether the load was successful.


```
vsoViewer.Load "C:\Users\User\Shapes.vsd"
```
