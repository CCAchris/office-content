# InvisibleApp.AppObjActivated Event (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Occurs after a Microsoft Visio instance becomes active.


## Syntax

Private Sub  _expression__**AppObjActivated**( **_ByVal app As [IVAPPLICATION]_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **InvisibleApp** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|app|Required| **[IVAPPLICATION]**|The instance of Visio that has become the active instance.|

## Remarks

The  **AppObjActivated** event indicates that an instance of Visio has become activeâ€”the instance of Visio that is retrieved by the **GetObject** method in a Microsoft Visual Basic program. The **AppObjActivated** event is different from the **AppActivated** event, which occurs after an instance of Visio becomes the active application on the Microsoft Windows desktop.

If you're using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own  **Event** objects, use the **Add** or **AddAdvise** method. To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **Add** method as it applies to the **EventList** collection. To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **AddAdvise** method. To find an event code for the event you want to create, see [Event codes](de8f5c7a-421d-ebcf-22b6-4310a202ef64.md).
