 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)

 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns status information for an object. Read-only.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Stat**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If an object is a reference to an entity in a document, and if that document closes, the  **Stat** property returns a value in which the **visStatClosed** bit is set.

If an object is a reference to an entity that has been deleted, the  **Stat** property returns a value in which the **visStatDeleted** bit is set.

A Component Object Model (COM) object, such as a Microsoft Visio  **Document** object, lives as long as it is held (pointed to) by a client, even if the object is logically in a deleted or closed state.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **Stat** property to check the status of a **Document** object. Executing the macro prints 0 ( **visStatNormal**) and then 8 ( **visStatClosed**) in the  **Immediate** window.


```
 
Public Sub Stat_Example() 
 
 Dim vsoDocument As Visio.Document 
 Set vsoDocument = Documents.Add("") 
 Debug.Print vsoDocument.Stat 
 vsoDocument.Close 
 Debug.Print vsoDocument.Stat 
 
End Sub 

```
