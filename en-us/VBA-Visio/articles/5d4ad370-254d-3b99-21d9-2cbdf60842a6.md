 _expression_. **UndoLevels**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **ApplicationSettings** object.


### Return Value

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Setting the  **UndoLevels** property is equivalent to setting the **Undo levels** option on the **General** tab in the **Visio Options** dialog box (click the **File** tab, and then click **Options**).

The minimum possible value for  **UndoLevels** is 0 (zero); the maximum is 99. The default value is 20.

The higher the value of  **UndoLevels**, the more memory is required to store the actions.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **UndoLevels** property to print the current number of undo levels in the Immediate window. It also shows how to get an **ApplicationSettings** object from the Visio **Application** object.


```
Public Sub UndoLevels_Example() 
 
    Dim vsoApplicationSettings As Visio.ApplicationSettings 
    Dim lngUndoLevels As Long 
 
    Set vsoApplicationSettings = Visio.Application.Settings 
    lngUndoLevels = vsoApplicationSettings.UndoLevels 
 
    Debug.Print lngUndoLevels 
 
End Sub
```
