# Label Control

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Displays descriptive text.
 **Remarks**
A  **Label** control on a form displays descriptive text such as titles, captions, pictures, or brief instructions. For example, labels for an address book might include a **Label** for a name, street, or city. A **Label** doesn't display values from [data sources](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md) or expressions; it is always [unbound](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md) and doesn't change as you move from record to record.
The default property for a  **Label** is the **Caption** property.
The default event for a  **Label** is the Click event.
