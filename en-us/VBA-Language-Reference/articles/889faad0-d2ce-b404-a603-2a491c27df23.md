# Page Object

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


One page of a  **MultiPage** and a single member of a **Pages** collection.
 **Remarks**
Each  **Page** object contains its own set of controls and does not necessarily rely on other pages in the [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for information. A **Page** inherits some properties from its [container](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md); the value of each  [inherited property](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md) is set by the container.
A  **Page** has a unique name and index value within a **Pages** collection. You can reference a **Page** by either its name or its index value. The index of the first **Page** in a collection is 0; the index of the second **Page** is 1; and so on. When two **Page** objects have the same name, you must reference each **Page** by its index value. References to the name in code will access only the first **Page** that uses the name.
The default name for the first  **Page** is Page1; the default name for the second **Page** is Page2.
