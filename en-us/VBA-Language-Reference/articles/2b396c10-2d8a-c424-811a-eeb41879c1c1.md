## Tab Options

 **Code Settings**




- Auto Syntax Check â€” Determines whether Visual Basic should automatically verify correct syntax after you enter a line of code.
    
- Require Variable Declaration â€” Determines whether explicit variable declarations are required in modules. Selecting this adds the Option Explicit statement to general declarations in any new module.
    
- Auto List Member â€” Displays a list that contains information that would logically complete the statement at the current insertion point.
    
- Auto Quick Info â€” Displays information about functions and their parameters as you type.
    
- Auto Data Tips â€” Displays the value of the variable over which your cursor is placed. Available only in Break mode.
    
- Auto Indent â€” Allows you to tab the first line of code; all subsequent lines will start at that tab location.
    
- Tab Width â€” Sets the tab width, which can range from 1 to 32 spaces; the default is 4 spaces.
    


 **Window Settings**




- Drag-and-Drop Text Editing â€” Allows you to drag and drop elements within the current code and from the  **Code** window into the **Immediate** or **Watch** windows.
    
- Default to Full Module View â€” Sets the default state for new modules to allow you to look at procedures in the  **Code** window either as a single scrollable list or only at one procedure at a time. It does not change the way currently open modules are viewed.
    
- Procedure Separator â€” Allows you to display or hide separator bars that appear at the end of each procedure in the  **Code** window.
