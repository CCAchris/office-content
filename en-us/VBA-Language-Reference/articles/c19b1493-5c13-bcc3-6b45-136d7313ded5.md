Allows you to register an  [add-in](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), load or unload it, and set its load behavior. If you close only the visible portions of an add-in â€” by double-clicking its system menu or by clicking its Close button, for example â€” its forms disappear from the screen, but the add-in is still present in memory. The add-in object itself will always stay resident in memory until the add-in is disconnected through the  **Add-In Manager** dialog box.

To open the Add-In Manager, Add-In Manager from the  **Add-Ins** menu.
