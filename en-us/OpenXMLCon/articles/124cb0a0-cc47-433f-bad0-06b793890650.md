This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office to programmatically retrieve information from a worksheet in a Spreadsheet document.

The following assembly directives are required to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using System;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;
using S = DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Sheets;
using E = DocumentFormat.OpenXml.OpenXmlElement;
using A = DocumentFormat.OpenXml.OpenXmlAttribute;

```




```VB.net
Imports System
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging
Imports S = DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Sheets
Imports E = DocumentFormat.OpenXml.OpenXmlElement
Imports A = DocumentFormat.OpenXml.OpenXmlAttribute

```



<a name="sectionSection1" />




## Create SpreadsheetDocument Object
In the Open XML SDK, the ** **SpreadsheetDocument**** class represents an Excel document package. To create an Excel document, you create an instance of the **SpreadsheetDocument** class and populate it with parts. At a minimum, the document must have a workbook part that serves as a container for the document, and at least one worksheet part. The text is represented in the package as XML using **SpreadsheetML** markup.

To create the class instance from the document you call one of the  **Open()** methods. In this example, you must open the file for read access only. Therefore, you can use the **Open(String, Boolean)** method, and set the Boolean parameter to **false**.

The following code example calls the  **Open** method to open the file specified by thefilepath for read-only access.


```C#
// Open file as read-only.
using (SpreadsheetDocument mySpreadsheet = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false))
```




```VB.net
' Open file as read-only.
Using mySpreadsheet As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, False)

```



The  **using** statement provides a recommended alternative to the typical .Open, .Save, .Close sequence. It ensures that the **Dispose** method (internal method used by the Open XML SDK to clean up resources) is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the **using** statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the **using** statement, in this casemySpreadsheet.

## Basic Structure of a SpreadsheetML
The basic document structure of a  **SpreadsheetML** document consists of the **Sheets** and **Sheet** elements, which reference the worksheets in the **Workbook**. A separate XML file is created for each  **Worksheet**. For example, the  **SpreadsheetML** for a workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is located in the Workbook.xml file and is shown in the following code example.


```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> 
<workbook xmlns=http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships">
    <sheets>
        <sheet name="MySheet1" sheetId="1" r:id="rId1" /> 
        <sheet name="MySheet2" sheetId="2" r:id="rId2" /> 
    </sheets>
</workbook>
```



The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as  **SheetData**.  **sheetData** represents the cell table and contains one or more **Row** elements. A **row** contains one or more **Cell** elements. Each cell contains a **CellValue** element that represents the value of the cell. For example, the SpreadsheetML for the first worksheet in a workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the Sheet1.xml file and is shown in the following code example.


```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> 
<worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main">
    <sheetData>
        <row r="1">
            <c r="A1">
                <v>100</v> 
            </c>
        </row>
    </sheetData>
</worksheet>

```



Using the Open XML SDK 2.5, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to  **SpreadsheetML** elements. You can find these classes in the **DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet** namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the **workbook**,  **sheets**,  **sheet**,  **worksheet**, and  **sheetData** elements.

## How the Sample Code Works
After you have opened the file for read-only access, you instantiate the  **Sheets** class.


```C#
S sheets = mySpreadsheet.WorkbookPart.Workbook.Sheets;
```




```VB.net
Dim sheets As S = mySpreadsheet.WorkbookPart.Workbook.Sheets
```



You then you iterate through the  **Sheets** collection and display **OpenXmlElement** and the **OpenXmlAttribute** in each element.


```C#
foreach (E sheet in sheets)
{
    foreach (A attr in sheet.GetAttributes())
    {
        Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", attr.LocalName, attr.Value);
    }
}

```




```VB.net
For Each sheet In sheets
    For Each attr In sheet.GetAttributes()
        Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", attr.LocalName, attr.Value)
    Next
Next

```



By displaying the attribute information you get the name and ID for each worksheet in the spreadsheet file.

<a name="sectionSection4" />




## Sample Code
In the following code example, you retrieve and display the attributes of the all sheets in the specified workbook contained in a  **SpreadsheetDocument** document. The following code example shows how to call the **GetSheetInfo** method.


```C#
GetSheetInfo(@"C:\Users\Public\Documents\Sheet5.xlsx");
```




```VB.net
GetSheetInfo("C:\Users\Public\Documents\Sheet5.xlsx")
```



The following is the complete code sample in both C# and Visual Basic.


```C#
public static void GetSheetInfo(string fileName)
{
    // Open file as read-only.
    using (SpreadsheetDocument mySpreadsheet = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false))
    {
        S sheets = mySpreadsheet.WorkbookPart.Workbook.Sheets;

        // For each sheet, display the sheet information.
        foreach (E sheet in sheets)
        {
            foreach (A attr in sheet.GetAttributes())
            {
                Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", attr.LocalName, attr.Value);
            }
        }
    }
}

```




```VB.net
Public Sub GetSheetInfo(ByVal fileName As String)
        ' Open file as read-only.
        Using mySpreadsheet As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, False)
            Dim sheets As S = mySpreadsheet.WorkbookPart.Workbook.Sheets

            ' For each sheet, display the sheet information.
            For Each sheet As E In sheets
                For Each attr As A In sheet.GetAttributes()
                    Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", attr.LocalName, attr.Value)
                Next
            Next
        End Using
    End Sub

```
