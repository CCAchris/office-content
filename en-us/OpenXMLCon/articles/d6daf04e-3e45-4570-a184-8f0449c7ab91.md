This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office to get all the external hyperlinks in a presentation programmatically.

The following assembly directives are required to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;
using Drawing = DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing;

```




```VB.net
Imports System
Imports System.Collections.Generic 
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging
Imports Drawing = DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing
```

## Getting a PresentationDocument Object
In the Open XML SDK, the  **PresentationDocument** class represents a presentation document package. To work with a presentation document, first create an instance of the **PresentationDocument** class, and then work with that instance. To create the class instance from the document call the **PresentationDocument.Open(String, Boolean)** method that uses a file path, and a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. Set this second parameter to **false** to open the file for read-only access, or **true** if you want to open the file for read/write access. In this topic, it is best to open the file for read-only access to protect the file against accidental writing. The following **using** statement opens the file for read-only access. In this code segment, thefileName parameter is a string that represents the path for the file from which you want to open the document.


```C#
// Open the presentation file as read-only.
using (PresentationDocument document = PresentationDocument.Open(fileName, false))
{
    // Insert other code here.
}

```




```VB.net
' Open the presentation file as read-only.
Using document As PresentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(fileName, False)
    ' Insert other code here.
End Using
```



The  **using** statement provides a recommended alternative to the typical .Open, .Save, .Close sequence. It ensures that the **Dispose** method (internal method used by the Open XML SDK to clean up resources) is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the **using** statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the **using** statement, in this casedocument.

## Basic Presentation Document Structure
The basic document structure of a  **PresentationML** document consists of the main part that contains the presentation definition. The following text from the [ISO/IEC 29500](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=194337) specification introduces the overall form of a **PresentationML** package.


> A  **PresentationML** package's main part starts with a presentation root element. That element contains a presentation, which, in turn, refers to a **slide** list, a_slide master_ list, a_notes master_ list, and a_handout master_ list. The slide list refers to all of the slides in the presentation; the slide master list refers to the entire slide masters used in the presentation; the notes master contains information about the formatting of notes pages; and the handout master describes how a handout looks.


> A _handout_ is a printed set of slides that can be provided to an_audience_ for future reference.


> As well as text and graphics, each slide can contain _comments_ and_notes_, can have a _layout_, and can be part of one or more _custom presentations_. (A comment is an annotation intended for the person maintaining the presentation slide deck. A note is a reminder or piece of text intended for the presenter or the audience.)


> Other features that a  **PresentationML** document can include the following:_animation_, _audio_, _video_, and _transitions_ between slides.


> A  **PresentationML** document is not stored as one large body in a single part. Instead, the elements that implement certain groupings of functionality are stored in separate parts. For example, all comments in a document are stored in one comment part while each slide has its own part.


> © ISO/IEC29500: 2008.

The following XML code segment represents a presentation that contains two slides denoted by the ID 267 and 256.


```XML
<p:presentation xmlns:p="…" … > 
   <p:sldMasterIdLst>
      <p:sldMasterId
         xmlns:rel="http://…/relationships" rel:id="rId1"/>
   </p:sldMasterIdLst>
   <p:notesMasterIdLst>
      <p:notesMasterId
         xmlns:rel="http://…/relationships" rel:id="rId4"/>
   </p:notesMasterIdLst>
   <p:handoutMasterIdLst>
      <p:handoutMasterId
         xmlns:rel="http://…/relationships" rel:id="rId5"/>
   </p:handoutMasterIdLst>
   <p:sldIdLst>
      <p:sldId id="267"
         xmlns:rel="http://…/relationships" rel:id="rId2"/>
      <p:sldId id="256"
         xmlns:rel="http://…/relationships" rel:id="rId3"/>
   </p:sldIdLst>
       <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000"/>
   <p:notesSz cx="6858000" cy="9144000"/>
</p:presentation>
```



Using the Open XML SDK 2.5, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to  **PresentationML** elements. You can find these classes in the **DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Presentation** namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the **sld**,  **sldLayout**,  **sldMaster**, and  **notesMaster** elements.

## Structure of the Hyperlink Element
In this how-to code example, you are going to work with external hyperlinks. Therefore, it is best to familiarize yourself with the hyperlink element. The following text from the  [ISO/IEC 29500](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=194337) specification introduces the **id** (Hyperlink Target).


> Specifies the ID of the relationship whose target shall be used as the target for thishyperlink.


> If this attribute is omitted, then there shall be no external hyperlink target for the current hyperlink - a location in the current document can still be target via the anchor attribute. If this attribute exists, it shall supersede the value in the anchor attribute.


> [_Example_: Consider the following  **PresentationML** fragment for a hyperlink:


```XML
<w:hyperlink r:id="rId9">
  <w:r>
    <w:t>http://www.example.com</w:t>
  </w:r>
</w:hyperlink>
```




> The  **id** attribute value of **rId9** specifies that relationship in the associated relationship part item with a corresponding Id attribute value must be navigated to when this hyperlink is invoked. For example, if the following XML is present in the associated relationship part item:


```XML
<Relationships xmlns="…">
  <Relationship Id="rId9" Mode="External"
Target=http://www.example.com />
</Relationships>
```




> The target of this hyperlink would therefore be the target of relationship  **rId9** - in this case, http://www.example.com._end example_]


> The possible values for this attribute are defined by the ST_RelationshipId simple type(§22.8.2.1).

## How the Sample Code Works
The sample code in this topic consists of one method that takes as a parameter the full path of the presentation file. It iterates through all the slides in the presentation and returns a list of strings that represent the Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) of all the external hyperlinks in the presentation.


```C#
// Iterate through all the slide parts in the presentation part.
foreach (SlidePart slidePart in document.PresentationPart.SlideParts)
{
    IEnumerable<Drawing.HyperlinkType> links = slidePart.Slide.Descendants<Drawing.HyperlinkType>();

    // Iterate through all the links in the slide part.
    foreach (Drawing.HyperlinkType link in links)
    {

        // Iterate through all the external relationships in the slide part. 
        foreach (HyperlinkRelationship relation in slidePart.HyperlinkRelationships)
        {
            // If the relationship ID matches the link ID…
            if (relation.Id.Equals(link.Id))
            {
                // Add the URI of the external relationship to the list of strings.
                ret.Add(relation.Uri.AbsoluteUri);

            }

```




```VB.net
' Iterate through all the slide parts in the presentation part.
For Each slidePart As SlidePart In document.PresentationPart.SlideParts
    Dim links As IEnumerable(Of Drawing.HyperlinkType) = slidePart.Slide.Descendants(Of Drawing.HyperlinkType)()

    ' Iterate through all the links in the slide part.
    For Each link As Drawing.HyperlinkType In links

        ' Iterate through all the external relationships in the slide part. 
        For Each relation As HyperlinkRelationship In slidePart.HyperlinkRelationships
            ' If the relationship ID matches the link ID…
            If relation.Id.Equals(link.Id) Then
                ' Add the URI of the external relationship to the list of strings.
                ret.Add(relation.Uri.AbsoluteUri)
            End If
```

## Sample Code
Following is the complete code sample that you can use to return the list of all external links in a presentation. You can use the following loop in your program to call the  **GetAllExternalHyperlinksInPresentation** method to get the list of URIs in your presentation.


```C#
string fileName = @"C:\Users\Public\Documents\Myppt7.pptx";
foreach (string s in GetAllExternalHyperlinksInPresentation(fileName))
    Console.WriteLine(s);
```




```VB.net
Dim fileName As String
fileName = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\Myppt7.pptx"
For Each s As String In GetAllExternalHyperlinksInPresentation(fileName)
    Console.WriteLine(s)
Next
```




```C#
// Returns all the external hyperlinks in the slides of a presentation.
public static IEnumerable<String> GetAllExternalHyperlinksInPresentation(string fileName)
{
    // Declare a list of strings.
    List<string> ret = new List<string>();

    // Open the presentation file as read-only.
    using (PresentationDocument document = PresentationDocument.Open(fileName, false))
    {
        // Iterate through all the slide parts in the presentation part.
        foreach (SlidePart slidePart in document.PresentationPart.SlideParts)
        {
            IEnumerable<Drawing.HyperlinkType> links = slidePart.Slide.Descendants<Drawing.HyperlinkType>();

            // Iterate through all the links in the slide part.
            foreach (Drawing.HyperlinkType link in links)
            {
                // Iterate through all the external relationships in the slide part. 
                foreach (HyperlinkRelationship relation in slidePart.HyperlinkRelationships)
                {
                    // If the relationship ID matches the link ID…
                    if (relation.Id.Equals(link.Id))
                    {
                        // Add the URI of the external relationship to the list of strings.
                        ret.Add(relation.Uri.AbsoluteUri);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the list of strings.
    return ret;
}

```




```VB.net
' Returns all the external hyperlinks in the slides of a presentation.
Public Function GetAllExternalHyperlinksInPresentation(ByVal fileName As String) As IEnumerable

    ' Declare a list of strings.
    Dim ret As List(Of String) = New List(Of String)

    ' Open the presentation file as read-only.
    Dim document As PresentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(fileName, False)

    Using (document)

        ' Iterate through all the slide parts in the presentation part.
        For Each slidePart As SlidePart In document.PresentationPart.SlideParts
            Dim links As IEnumerable = slidePart.Slide.Descendants(Of Drawing.HyperlinkType)()

            ' Iterate through all the links in the slide part.
            For Each link As Drawing.HyperlinkType In links

                ' Iterate through all the external relationships in the slide part.
                For Each relation As HyperlinkRelationship In slidePart.HyperlinkRelationships
                    ' If the relationship ID matches the link ID…
                    If relation.Id.Equals(link.Id) Then

                        ' Add the URI of the external relationship to the list of strings.
                        ret.Add(relation.Uri.AbsoluteUri)
                    End If
                Next
            Next
        Next


        ' Return the list of strings.
        Return ret

    End Using
End Function
```
