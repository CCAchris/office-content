# How to: Retrieve a list of the worksheets in a spreadsheet document (Open XML SDK)
This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office to programmatically retrieve a list of the worksheets in a Microsoft Excel 2010 or Microsoft Excel 2013 workbook, without loading the document into Excel. It contains an example  **GetAllWorksheets** method to illustrate this task.

 [Calling the GetAllWorksheets Method](#sectionSection1)

 [How the Code Works](#sectionSection2)

 [Sample Code](#sectionSection3)



To use the sample code in this topic, you must install the  [Open XML SDK 2.5](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30425). You must explicitly reference the following assemblies in your project:


- WindowsBase


- DocumentFormat.OpenXml (installed by the Open XML SDK)



You must also use the following  **using** directives or **Imports** statements to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using System;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet;
```




```VB.net
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet
```



<a name="sectionSection0" />




## GetAllWorksheets Method
You can use the  **GetAllWorksheets** method, which is shown in the following code, to retrieve a list of the worksheets in a workbook. The **GetAllWorksheets** method accepts a single parameter, a string that indicates the path of the file that you want to examine.


```C#
public static Sheets GetAllWorksheets(string fileName)
```




```VB.net
Public Function GetAllWorksheets(ByVal fileName As String) As Sheets
```



The method works with the workbook you specify, returning an instance of the  **Sheets** object, from which you can retrieve a reference to each **Sheet** object.

<a name="sectionSection1" />




## Calling the GetAllWorksheets Method
To call the  **GetAllWorksheets** method, pass the required value, as shown in the following code.


```C#
const string DEMOFILE = @"C:\Users\Public\Documents\SampleWorkbook.xlsx";

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var results = GetAllWorksheets(DEMOFILE);
    foreach (Sheet item in results)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(item.Name);
    }
}
```




```VB.net
Const DEMOFILE As String = 
    "C:\Samples\SampleWorkbook.xlsx"

Sub Main()
    Dim results = GetAllWorksheets(DEMOFILE)
    ' Because Sheet inherits from OpenXmlElement, you can cast
    ' each item in the collection to be a Sheet instance.
    For Each item As Sheet In results
        Console.WriteLine(item.Name)
    Next
End Sub
```



<a name="sectionSection2" />




## How the Code Works
The sample method,  **GetAllWorksheets**, creates a variable that will contain a reference to the  **Sheets** collection of the workbook. At the end of its work, the method returns the variable, which contains either a reference to the **Sheets** collection, or null/Nothing if there were no sheets (this cannot occur in a well-formed workbook).


```C#
Sheets theSheets = null;
// Code removed here…
return theSheets;
```




```VB.net
Dim theSheets As Sheets
' Code removed here…
Return theSheets

```



The code then continues by opening the document in read-only mode, and retrieving a reference to the  **WorkbookPart**.


```C#
using (SpreadsheetDocument document = 
    SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false))
{
    WorkbookPart wbPart = document.WorkbookPart;
    // Code removed here.
}

```




```VB.net
Using document As SpreadsheetDocument = 
    SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, False)
    Dim wbPart As WorkbookPart = document.WorkbookPart
    ' Code removed here.
End Using

```



To get access to the  **Workbook** object, the code retrieves the value of the **Workbook** property from the **WorkbookPart**, and then retrieves a reference to the  **Sheets** object from the **Sheets** property of the **Workbook**. The  **Sheets** object contains the collection of **Sheet** objects that provide the method's return value.


```C#
theSheets = wbPart.Workbook.Sheets;

```




```VB.net
theSheets = wbPart.Workbook.Sheets

```

## Sample Code
The following is the complete  **GetAllWorksheets** code sample in C# and Visual Basic.


```C#
using System;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet;

namespace GetAllWorkheets
{
    class Program
    {
        const string DEMOFILE = 
            @"C:\Users\Public\Documents\SampleWorkbook.xlsx";

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var results = GetAllWorksheets(DEMOFILE);
            foreach (Sheet item in results)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item.Name);
            }
        }

        // Retrieve a List of all the sheets in a workbook.
        // The Sheets class contains a collection of 
        // OpenXmlElement objects, each representing one of 
        // the sheets.
        public static Sheets GetAllWorksheets(string fileName)
        {
            Sheets theSheets = null;

            using (SpreadsheetDocument document = 
                SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false))
            {
                WorkbookPart wbPart = document.WorkbookPart;
                theSheets = wbPart.Workbook.Sheets;
            }
            return theSheets;
        }
    }
}
```




```VB.net
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet

Module Module1

    Const DEMOFILE As String = 
        "C:\Users\Public\Documents\SampleWorkbook.xlsx"
    
    Sub Main()
        Dim results = GetAllWorksheets(DEMOFILE)
        ' Because Sheet inherits from OpenXmlElement, you can cast
        ' each item in the collection to be a Sheet instance.
        For Each item As Sheet In results
            Console.WriteLine(item.Name)
        Next
    End Sub

    ' Retrieve a list of all the sheets in a Workbook.
    ' The Sheets class contains a collection of 
    ' OpenXmlElement objects, each representing 
    ' one of the sheets.
    Public Function GetAllWorksheets(ByVal fileName As String) As Sheets
        Dim theSheets As Sheets
        Using document As SpreadsheetDocument = 
            SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, False)
            Dim wbPart As WorkbookPart = document.WorkbookPart
            theSheets = wbPart.Workbook.Sheets()
        End Using
        Return theSheets
    End Function
End Module
```
