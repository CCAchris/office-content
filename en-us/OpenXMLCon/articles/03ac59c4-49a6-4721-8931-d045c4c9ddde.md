This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office to programmatically create a spreadsheet document.

The following assembly directives are required to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet;

```




```VisualBasic
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet

```

## Getting a SpreadsheetDocument Object


In the Open XML SDK, the ** **SpreadsheetDocument**** class represents an Excel document package. To create an Excel document, create an instance of the **SpreadsheetDocument** class and populate it with parts. At a minimum, the document must have a workbook part that serves as a container for the document, and at least one worksheet part. The text is represented in the package as XML using **SpreadsheetML** markup.

To create the class instance, call the  **Create(Package, SpreadsheetDocumentType)** method. Several **Create** methods are provided, each with a different signature. The sample code in this topic uses the **Create** method with a signature that requires two parameters. The first parameter,package, takes a full path string that represents the document that you want to create. The second parameter, type, is a member of the  **SpreadsheetDocumentType** enumeration. This parameter represents the document type. For example, there are different members of the **SpreadsheetDocumentType** enumeration for add-ins, templates, workbooks, and macro-enabled templates and workbooks.


**Note**  Select the appropriate  **SpreadsheetDocumentType** and ensure that the persisted file has the correct, matching file name extension. If the **SpreadsheetDocumentType** does not match the file name extension, an error occurs when you open the file in Excel.


  The following code example calls the  **Create** method.


```C#
SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = 
SpreadsheetDocument.Create(filepath, SpreadsheetDocumentType.Workbook);
```




```VisualBasic
Dim spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = _
SpreadsheetDocument.Create(filepath, SpreadsheetDocumentType.Workbook)
```



When you have created the Excel document package, you can add parts to it. To add the workbook part you call the  **AddWorkbookPart()** method of the **SpreadsheetDocument** class. A workbook part must have at least one worksheet. To add a worksheet, create a new **Sheet**. When you create a new  **Sheet**, associate the  **Sheet** with the **Workbook** by passing theId, SheetId andName parameters. Use the **GetIdOfPart(OpenXmlPart)** method to get theId of the **Sheet**. Then add the new sheet to the  **Sheet** collection by calling the **Append([])** method of the **Sheets** class. The following code example creates a new worksheet, associates the worksheet, and appends the worksheet to the workbook.


```C#
Sheet sheet = new Sheet() { Id = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.
GetIdOfPart(worksheetPart), SheetId = 1, Name = "mySheet" };
sheets.Append(sheet);
```




```VisualBasic
Dim sheet As New Sheet() With {.Id = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.GetIdOfPart(worksheetPart), .SheetId = 1, .Name = "mySheet"}
sheets.Append(sheet)
```

## Basic Structure of a SpreadsheetML Document
The following code example is the  **SpreadsheetML** markup for the workbook that the sample code creates.


```XML
<x:workbook xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships" xmlns:x="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main">
  <x:sheets>
    <x:sheet name="mySheet" sheetId="1" r:id="R47fd958b504b4526" />
  </x:sheets>
</x:workbook>
```



The basic document structure of a  **SpreadsheetML** document consists of the **Sheets** and **Sheet** elements, which reference the worksheets in the workbook. A separate XML file is created for each worksheet. The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as **SheetData**.  **sheetData** represents the cell table and contains one or more **Row** elements. A **row** contains one or more **Cell** elements. Each cell contains a **CellValue** element that represents the cell value. The following code example is the SpreadsheetML markup for the worksheet created by the sample code.


```XML
<x:worksheet xmlns:x="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main">
  <x:sheetData />
</x:worksheet>
```



Using the Open XML SDK 2.5, you can create document structure and content by using strongly-typed classes that correspond to SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the  **DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet** namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the **workbook**,  **sheets**,  **sheet**,  **worksheet**, and  **sheetData** elements.

## Generating the SpreadsheetML Markup
To create the basic document structure using the Open XML SDK, instantiate the  **Workbook** class, assign it to the **WorkbookPart** property of the main document part, and then add instances of the **WorksheetPart**,  **Worksheet**, and  **Sheet** classes. This is shown in the sample code and generates the required **SpreadsheetML** markup.

## Sample Code
The  **CreateSpreadsheetWorkbook** method shown here can be used to create a basic Excel document, a workbook with one sheet named "mySheet". To call it in your program, you can use the following code example that creates a file named "Sheet2.xlsx" in the public documents folder.


```C#
CreateSpreadsheetWorkbook(@"c:\Users\Public\Documents\Sheet2.xlsx")
```




```VisualBasic
CreateSpreadsheetWorkbook("c:\Users\Public\Documents\Sheet2.xlsx")
```



Notice that the file name extension, .xlsx, matches the type of file specified by the  **SpreadsheetDocumentType.Workbook** parameter in the call to the **Create** method.

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.


```C#
public static void CreateSpreadsheetWorkbook(string filepath)
{
    // Create a spreadsheet document by supplying the filepath.
    // By default, AutoSave = true, Editable = true, and Type = xlsx.
    SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.
        Create(filepath, SpreadsheetDocumentType.Workbook);

    // Add a WorkbookPart to the document.
    WorkbookPart workbookpart = spreadsheetDocument.AddWorkbookPart();
    workbookpart.Workbook = new Workbook();

    // Add a WorksheetPart to the WorkbookPart.
    WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookpart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();
    worksheetPart.Worksheet = new Worksheet(new SheetData());

    // Add Sheets to the Workbook.
    Sheets sheets = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.Workbook.
        AppendChild<Sheets>(new Sheets());

    // Append a new worksheet and associate it with the workbook.
    Sheet sheet = new Sheet() { Id = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.
        GetIdOfPart(worksheetPart), SheetId = 1, Name = "mySheet" };
    sheets.Append(sheet);

    workbookpart.Workbook.Save();

    // Close the document.
    spreadsheetDocument.Close();
}
```




```VisualBasic
Public Sub CreateSpreadsheetWorkbook(ByVal filepath As String)
    ' Create a spreadsheet document by supplying the filepath.
    ' By default, AutoSave = true, Editable = true, and Type = xlsx.
    Dim spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = _
spreadsheetDocument.Create(filepath, SpreadsheetDocumentType.Workbook)

    ' Add a WorkbookPart to the document.
    Dim workbookpart As WorkbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.AddWorkbookPart
    workbookpart.Workbook = New Workbook

    ' Add a WorksheetPart to the WorkbookPart.
    Dim worksheetPart As WorksheetPart = workbookpart.AddNewPart(Of WorksheetPart)()
    worksheetPart.Worksheet = New Worksheet(New SheetData())

    ' Add Sheets to the Workbook.
    Dim sheets As Sheets = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.Workbook.AppendChild(Of Sheets)(New Sheets())

    ' Append a new worksheet and associate it with the workbook.
    Dim sheet As Sheet = New Sheet
    sheet.Id = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.GetIdOfPart(worksheetPart)
    sheet.SheetId = 1
    sheet.Name = "mySheet"

    sheets.Append(sheet)

    workbookpart.Workbook.Save()

    ' Close the document.
    spreadsheetDocument.Close()
End Sub
```
