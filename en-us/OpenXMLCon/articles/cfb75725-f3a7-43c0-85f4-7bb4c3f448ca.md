This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office to programmatically replace a document part in a word processing document.

The following assembly directives are required to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using System.IO;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;

```




```VisualBasic
Imports System.IO
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging

```

## Packages and Document Parts
An Open XML document is stored as a package, whose format is defined by  [ISO/IEC 29500-2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=194337). The package can have multiple parts with relationships between them. The relationship between parts controls the category of the document. A document can be defined as a word-processing document if its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a main document part. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a presentation part it can be defined as a presentation document. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a workbook part, it is defined as a spreadsheet document. In this how-to topic, you will use a word-processing document package.

## Getting a WordprocessingDocument Object
In the sample code, you start by opening the word processing file by instantiating the  **WordprocessingDocument** class as shown in the following **using** statement. In the same statement, you open the word processing file_document_ by using the **Open** method, with the Boolean parameter set to **true** to enable editing the document.


```C#
using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = 
        WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true))
{
    // Insert other code here.
}
```




```VisualBasic
Using wordDoc As WordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, True)
    ' Insert other code here.
End Using
```



The  **using** statement provides a recommended alternative to the typical .Open, .Save, .Close sequence. It ensures that the **Dispose** method (internal method used by the Open XML SDK to clean up resources) is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the **using** statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the **using** statement, in this case_wordDoc_. Because the  **WordprocessingDocument** class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its **System.IDisposable** implementation, and because **Dispose** is automatically called when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call **Save** and **Close**-as long as you use  **using**.

## How to Change Theme in a Word Package
If you would like to change the theme in a Word document, click the ribbon Page Layout and then clickThemes. The Themes pull-down menu opens. To choose one of the built it themes and apply it to the Word document, click the theme icon. You can also use the optionBrowse for Themes... to locate and apply a theme file in your computer.

## The Structure of the Theme Element
The theme element constitutes of color, font, and format schemes. In this how-to you learn how to change the theme programmatically. Therefore, it is useful to familiarize yourself with the theme element. The following information from the  [ISO/IEC 29500](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=194337) specification can be useful when working with this element.

This element defines the root level complex type associated with a shared style sheet (or theme). This element holds all the different formatting options available to a document through a theme, and defines the overall look and feel of the document when themed objects are used within the document. 

[_Example_: Consider the following image as an example of different themes in use applied to a presentation. In this example, you can see how a theme can affect font, colors, backgrounds, fills, and effects for different objects in a presentation. end example]

In this example, we see how a theme can affect font, colors, backgrounds, fills, and effects for different objects in a presentation. _end example_]

The following table lists the possible child types of the Theme class.

The following XML Schema fragment defines the four parts of the theme element. The  **themeElements** element is the piece that holds the main formatting defined within the theme. The other parts provide overrides, defaults, and additions to the information contained in **themeElements**. The complex type defining a theme,  **CT_OfficeStyleSheet**, is defined in the following manner:


```XML
<complexType name="CT_OfficeStyleSheet">
   <sequence>
       <element name="themeElements" type="CT_BaseStyles" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
       <element name="objectDefaults" type="CT_ObjectStyleDefaults" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
       <element name="extraClrSchemeLst" type="CT_ColorSchemeList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
       <element name="custClrLst" type="CT_CustomColorList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
       <element name="extLst" type="CT_OfficeArtExtensionList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
   </sequence>
   <attribute name="name" type="xsd:string" use="optional" default=""/>
</complexType>

```



This complex type also holds a  **CT_OfficeArtExtensionList**, which is used for future extensibility of this complex type.

## How the Sample Code Works
After opening the file, you can instantiate the  **MainDocumentPart** in the_wordDoc_ object, and delete the old theme part.


```C#
public static void ReplaceTheme(string document, string themeFile)
{
    using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc =
        WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true))
    {
        MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart;

        // Delete the old document part.
        mainPart.DeletePart(mainPart.ThemePart);

```




```VisualBasic
Public Shared Sub ReplaceTheme(ByVal document As String, ByVal themeFile As String)
    Using wordDoc As WordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, True)
        Dim mainPart As MainDocumentPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart

        ' Delete the old document part.
        mainPart.DeletePart(mainPart.ThemePart)
```



You can then create add a new  **ThemePart** object and add it to the **MainDocumentPart** object. Then you add content by using a **StreamReader** and **StreamWriter** objects to copy the theme from the_themeFile_ to the **ThemePart** object.


```C#
// Add a new document part and then add content.
ThemePart themePart = mainPart.AddNewPart<ThemePart>();

using (StreamReader streamReader = new StreamReader(themeFile))
using (StreamWriter streamWriter =
    new StreamWriter(themePart.GetStream(FileMode.Create)))
{
    streamWriter.Write(streamReader.ReadToEnd());
}
```




```VisualBasic
' Add a new document part and then add content.
Dim themePart As ThemePart = mainPart.AddNewPart(Of ThemePart)()

Using streamReader As New StreamReader(themeFile)
Using streamWriter As New StreamWriter(themePart.GetStream(FileMode.Create))
    streamWriter.Write(streamReader.ReadToEnd())
End Using
End Using
```

## Sample Code
The following code example shows how to replace the theme document part in a word processing document with the theme part from another package. The theme file passed as the second argument must be a valid theme part in XML format (for example, Theme1.xml). You can extract this part from an existing document or theme file (.THMX) that has been renamed to be a .Zip file. To call the method  **ReplaceTheme** you can use the following call example to copy the theme from the file "Theme1.xml" to the file "MyPkg7.docx."


```C#
string document = @"C:\Users\Public\Documents\\MyPkg7.docx";
string themeFile = @"C:\Users\Public\Documents\Theme1.xml";
ReplaceTheme(document, themeFile);
```




```VisualBasic
Dim document As String = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\\MyPkg7.docx"
Dim themeFile As String = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\Theme1.xml"
ReplaceTheme(document, themeFile)
```



After you run the program open the Word file and notice the change in font. 

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.


```C#
// This method can be used to replace the theme part in a package.
public static void ReplaceTheme(string document, string themeFile)
{
    using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = 
        WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true))
    {
        MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart;
        
        // Delete the old document part.
        mainPart.DeletePart(mainPart.ThemePart);
        
        // Add a new document part and then add content.
        ThemePart themePart = mainPart.AddNewPart<ThemePart>();

        using (StreamReader streamReader = new StreamReader(themeFile))
        using (StreamWriter streamWriter = 
            new StreamWriter(themePart.GetStream(FileMode.Create)))
        {
            streamWriter.Write(streamReader.ReadToEnd());
        }
    }
}
```




```VisualBasic
' This method can be used to replace a document part in a package.
Public Sub ReplaceTheme(ByVal document As String, ByVal themeFile As String)
    Using wordDoc As WordprocessingDocument = _
        WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, True)
        Dim mainPart As MainDocumentPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart
        
        ' Delete the old document part.
        mainPart.DeletePart(mainPart.ThemePart)
        
        ' Add a new document part and then add content.
        Dim themePart As ThemePart = mainPart.AddNewPart(Of ThemePart)()
        
        Using streamReader As New StreamReader(themeFile)
            Using streamWriter As _
                New StreamWriter(themePart.GetStream(FileMode.Create))
                
                streamWriter.Write(streamReader.ReadToEnd())
            End Using
        End Using
    End Using
End Sub
```
