This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office to add a document part (file) to a word processing document programmatically.

The following assembly directives are required to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using System.IO;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;
```




```VB.net
Imports System.IO
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging
```

## Packages and Document Parts
An Open XML document is stored as a package, whose format is defined by  [ISO/IEC 29500-2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=194337). The package can have multiple parts with relationships between them. The relationship between parts controls the category of the document. A document can be defined as a word-processing document if its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a main document part. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a presentation part it can be defined as a presentation document. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a workbook part, it is defined as a spreadsheet document. In this how-to topic, you will use a word-processing document package.

## Getting a WordprocessingDocument Object
The code starts with opening a package file by passing a file name to one of the overloaded  **Open()** methods of the **DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.WordprocessingDocument** that takes a string and a Boolean value that specifies whether the file should be opened for editing or for read-only access. In this case, the Boolean value is **true** specifying that the file should be opened in read/write mode.


```C#
using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true))
{
    // Insert other code here.
}
```




```VB.net
Using wordDoc As WordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, True)
    ' Insert other code here.
End Using
```



The  **using** statement provides a recommended alternative to the typical .Create, .Save, .Close sequence. It ensures that the **Dispose** method (internal method used by the Open XML SDK to clean up resources) is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the **using** statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the **using** statement, in this case **wordDoc**. Because the  **WordprocessingDocument** class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its **System.IDisposable** implementation, and because the **Dispose** method is automatically called when you exit the block; you do not have to explicitly call **Save** and **Close**-as long as you use  **using**.

## Basic Structure of a WordProcessingML Document
The basic document structure of a  **WordProcessingML** document consists of the **document** and **body** elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as **p**, which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more  **r** elements. The **r** stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more **t** elements. The **t** element contains a range of text. The **WordprocessingML** markup for the document that the sample code creates is shown in the following code example.


```XML
<w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main">
  <w:body>
    <w:p>
      <w:r>
        <w:t>Create text in body - CreateWordprocessingDocument</w:t>
      </w:r>
    </w:p>
  </w:body>
</w:document>
```



Using the Open XML SDK 2.5, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to  **WordprocessingML** elements. You can find these classes in the **DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing** namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the **document**,  **body**,  **p**,  **r**, and  **t** elements,

## How the Sample Code Works
After opening the document for editing, in the  **using** statement, as a **WordprocessingDocument** object, the code creates a reference to the **MainDocumentPart** part and adds a new custom XML part. It then reads the contents of the external file that contains the custom XML and writes it to the **CustomXmlPart** part.


**Note**  To use the new document part in the document, add a link to the document part in the relationship part for the new part.


  
```C#
MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart;
CustomXmlPart myXmlPart = mainPart.AddCustomXmlPart(CustomXmlPartType.CustomXml);

using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Open))
{
    myXmlPart.FeedData(stream);
}
```




```VB.net
Dim mainPart As MainDocumentPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart

Dim myXmlPart As CustomXmlPart = mainPart.AddCustomXmlPart(CustomXmlPartType.CustomXml)

Using stream As New FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Open)
    myXmlPart.FeedData(stream)
End Using
```

## Sample Code
The following code adds a new document part that contains custom XML from an external file and then populates the part. To call the AddCustomXmlPart method in your program, you can use the following example that modifies the file "myPkg2.docx" by adding a new document part to it.


```C#
string document = @"C:\Users\Public\Documents\myPkg2.docx";
string fileName = @"C:\Users\Public\Documents\myXML.xml";
AddNewPart(document, fileName);

```




```VB.net
Dim document As String = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\myPkg2.docx"
Dim fileName As String = "C:\Users\Public\Documents\myXML.xml"
AddNewPart(document, fileName)

```




**Note**  Before you run the program, change the Word file extension from .docx to .zip, and view the content of the zip file. Then change the extension back to .docx and run the program. After running the program, change the file extension again to .zip and view its content. You will see an extra folder named "customXML." This folder contains the XML file that represents the added part 


  Following is the complete code example in both C# and Visual Basic.


```C#
// To add a new document part to a package.
public static void AddNewPart(string document, string fileName)
{
    using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true))
    {
        MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart;

        CustomXmlPart myXmlPart = mainPart.AddCustomXmlPart(CustomXmlPartType.CustomXml);

        using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Open))
        {
            myXmlPart.FeedData(stream);
        }
    }
}

```




```VB.net
' To add a new document part to a package.
Public Sub AddNewPart(ByVal document As String, ByVal fileName As String)
    Using wordDoc As WordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, True)
        Dim mainPart As MainDocumentPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart
        
        Dim myXmlPart As CustomXmlPart = mainPart.AddCustomXmlPart(CustomXmlPartType.CustomXml)
        
        Using stream As New FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Open)
            myXmlPart.FeedData(stream)
        End Using
    End Using
End Sub
```
