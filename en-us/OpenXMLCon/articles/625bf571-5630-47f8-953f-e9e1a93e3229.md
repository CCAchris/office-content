This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office to open a spreadsheet document for read-only access programmatically.

The following assembly directives are required to compile the code in this topic.


```C#
using System.IO;
using System.IO.Packaging;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;
using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet;
```




```VB.net
Imports System.IO
Imports System.IO.Packaging
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging
Imports DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet
```

## When to Open a Document for Read-Only Access
Sometimes you want to open a document to inspect or retrieve some information, and you want to do this in a way that ensures the document remains unchanged. In these instances, you want to open the document for read-only access. This How To topic discusses several ways to programmatically open a read-only spreadsheet document.

## Getting a SpreadsheetDocument Object
In the Open XML SDK, the  **SpreadsheetDocument** class represents an Excel document package. To create an Excel document, you create an instance of the **SpreadsheetDocument** class and populate it with parts. At a minimum, the document must have a workbook part that serves as a container for the document, and at least one worksheet part. The text is represented in the package as XML using SpreadsheetML markup.

To create the class instance from the document that you call one of the  **Open()** overload methods. Several **Open** methods are provided, each with a different signature. The methods that let you specify whether a document is editable are listed in the following table.


****

<table xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mtps="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/mtps" xmlns:mshelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" xmlns:ddue="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><tr><th><p>Open Method</p></th><th><p>Class Library Reference Topic</p></th><th><p>Description</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Open(String, Boolean)</p></td><td><p><span sdata="cer" target="M:DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.SpreadsheetDocument.Open(System.String,System.Boolean)"><span class="nolink">Open(String, Boolean)</span></span></p></td><td><p>Create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class from the specified file.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Open(Stream, Boolean)</p></td><td><p><span sdata="cer" target="M:DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.SpreadsheetDocument.Open(System.IO.Stream,System.Boolean)"><span class="nolink">Open(Stream, Boolean)</span></span></p></td><td><p>Create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class from the specified IO stream.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Open(String, Boolean, OpenSettings)</p></td><td><p><span sdata="cer" target="M:DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.SpreadsheetDocument.Open(System.String,System.Boolean,DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenSettings)"><span class="nolink">Open(String, Boolean, OpenSettings)</span></span></p></td><td><p>Create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class from the specified file.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Open(Stream, Boolean, OpenSettings)</p></td><td><p><span sdata="cer" target="M:DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.SpreadsheetDocument.Open(System.IO.Stream,System.Boolean,DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenSettings)"><span class="nolink">Open(Stream, Boolean, OpenSettings)</span></span></p></td><td><p>Create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class from the specified I/O stream.</p></td></tr></table>
The table earlier in this topic lists only those  **Open** methods that accept a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. To open a document for read-only access, specify **False** for this parameter.

Notice that two of the  **Open** methods create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class based on a string as the first parameter. The first example in the sample code uses this technique. It uses the first **Open** method in the table earlier in this topic; with a signature that requires two parameters. The first parameter takes a string that represents the full path file name from which you want to open the document. The second parameter is either **true** or **false**. This example uses  **false** and indicates that you want to open the file as read-only.

The following code example calls the  **Open** Method.


```C#
// Open a SpreadsheetDocument for read-only access based on a filepath.
using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(filepath, false))
```




```VB.net
' Open a SpreadsheetDocument for read-only access based on a filepath.
Using spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(filepath, False)
```



The other two  **Open** methods create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class based on an input/output stream. You might use this approach, for example, if you have a Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 application that uses stream input/output, and you want to use the Open XML SDK 2.5 to work with a document.

The following code example opens a document based on a stream.


```C#
Stream stream = File.Open(strDoc, FileMode.Open);
// Open a SpreadsheetDocument for read-only access based on a stream.
using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument =
    SpreadsheetDocument.Open(stream, false))
```




```VB.net
Dim stream As Stream = File.Open(strDoc, FileMode.Open)
' Open a SpreadsheetDocument for read-only access based on a stream.
Using spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(stream, False)
```



Suppose you have an application that uses the Open XML support in the System.IO.Packaging namespace of the .NET Framework Class Library, and you want to use the Open XML SDK 2.5 to work with a package as read-only. Whereas the Open XML SDK 2.5 includes method overloads that accept a  **Package** as the first parameter, there is not one that takes a Boolean as the second parameter to indicate whether the document should be opened for editing.

The recommended method is to open the package as read-only at first, before creating the instance of the  **SpreadsheetDocument** class, as shown in the second example in the sample code. The following code example performs this operation.


```C#
// Open System.IO.Packaging.Package.
Package spreadsheetPackage = Package.Open(filepath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);

// Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a package.
using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument =
    SpreadsheetDocument.Open(spreadsheetPackage))
```




```VB.net
' Open System.IO.Packaging.Package.
Dim spreadsheetPackage As Package = Package.Open(filepath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read)

' Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a package.
Using spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(spreadsheetPackage)
```



After you open the spreadsheet document package, you can access the main workbook part. To access the main workbook part, you assign a reference to the existing workbook part, as shown in the following code example.


```C#
// Assign a reference to the existing workbook part.
WorkbookPart wbPart = document.WorkbookPart;

```




```VB.net
' Assign a reference to the existing workbook part.
Dim wbPart As WorkbookPart = document.WorkbookPart
```

## Basic Document Structure
The basic document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the  **Sheets** and **Sheet** elements, which reference the worksheets in the **Workbook**. A separate XML file is created for each  **Worksheet**. For example, the SpreadsheetML for a workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is located in the Workbook.xml file and is as follows.


```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> 
<workbook xmlns=http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships">
    <sheets>
        <sheet name="MySheet1" sheetId="1" r:id="rId1" /> 
        <sheet name="MySheet2" sheetId="2" r:id="rId2" /> 
    </sheets>
</workbook>

```



The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as  **SheetData**.  **sheetData** represents the cell table and contains one or more **Row** elements. A **row** contains one or more **Cell** elements. Each cell contains a **CellValue** element that represents the value of the cell. For example, the SpreadsheetML for the first worksheet in a workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the Sheet1.xml file and is as follows.


```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> 
<worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main">
    <sheetData>
        <row r="1">
            <c r="A1">
                <v>100</v> 
            </c>
        </row>
    </sheetData>
</worksheet>
```



Using the Open XML SDK 2.5, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the  **DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet** namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the **workbook**,  **sheets**,  **sheet**,  **worksheet**, and  **sheetData** elements.

## Attempt to Generate the SpreadsheetML Markup to Add a Worksheet
The sample code shows how, when you try to add a new worksheet, you get an exception error because the file is read-only. When you have access to the body of the main document part, you add a worksheet by calling the  **AddNewPart<T>(String, String)** method to create a new **WorksheetPart**. The following code example attempts to add the new  **WorksheetPart**.


```C#
public static void OpenSpreadsheetDocumentReadonly(string filepath)
{
    // Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a filepath.
    using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(filepath, false))
    {
        // Attempt to add a new WorksheetPart.
        // The call to AddNewPart generates an exception because the file is read-only.
        WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();

        // The rest of the code will not be called.
    }
}

```




```VB.net
Public Shared Sub OpenSpreadsheetDocumentReadonly(ByVal filepath As String)
    ' Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a filepath.
    Using spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(filepath, False)
        ' Attempt to add a new WorksheetPart.
        ' The call to AddNewPart generates an exception because the file is read-only.
        Dim newWorksheetPart As WorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart(Of WorksheetPart)()

        ' The rest of the code will not be called.
    End Using
End Sub
```

## Sample Code
The following code sample is used to open a Spreadsheet Document for Read-only Access. You can call the  **OpenSpreadsheetDocumentReadonl** method by using the following code, which opens the file "Sheet10.xlsx," as an example.


```C#
OpenSpreadsheetDocumentReadonly(@"C:\Users\Public\Documents\Sheet10.xlsx");
```




```VB.net
OpenSpreadsheetDocumentReadonly("C:\Users\Public\Documents\Sheet10.xlsx")
```



The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.


```C#
public static void OpenSpreadsheetDocumentReadonly(string filepath)
{
    // Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a filepath.
    using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(filepath, false))
    {
        // Attempt to add a new WorksheetPart.
        // The call to AddNewPart generates an exception because the file is read-only.
        WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();

        // The rest of the code will not be called.
    }
}
```




```VB.net
Public Sub OpenSpreadsheetDocumentReadonly(ByVal filepath As String)
    ' Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a filepath.
    Using spreadsheetDocument As SpreadsheetDocument = spreadsheetDocument.Open(filepath, False)
        ' Attempt to add a new WorksheetPart.
        ' The call to AddNewPart generates an exception because the file is read-only.
        Dim newWorksheetPart As WorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart(Of WorksheetPart)()

        ' The rest of the code will not be called.
    End Using
End Sub
```
