Logs the user on to MAPI, obtaining a MAPI session.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Logon**( **_Profile_**,  **_Password_**,  **_ShowDialog_**,  **_NewSession_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **NameSpace** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Profile|Optional| **Variant**|The MAPI profile name, as a  **String**, to use for the session. Specify an empty string to use the default profile for the current session.|
|Password|Optional| **Variant**|The password (if any), as a  **String**, associated with the profile. This parameter exists only for backwards compatibility and for security reasons, it is not recommended for use. Microsoft Oultook will prompt the user to specify a password in most system configurations. This is your logon password and should not be confused with PST passwords.|
|ShowDialog|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to display the MAPI logon dialog box to allow the user to select a MAPI profile.|
|NewSession|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to create a new Microsoft Outlook session. Since multiple sessions cannot be created in Outlook, this parameter should be specified as True only if a session does not already exist.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Use the  **Logon** method only to log on to a specific profile when Outlook is not already running. This is because only one Outlook process can run at a time, and that Outlook process uses only one profile and supports only one MAPI session. When users start Outlook a second time, that instance of Outlook runs within the same Outlook process, does not create a new process, and uses the same profile.

If Outlook is already running, using this method does not create a new Outlook session or change the current profile to a different one. 

If Outlook is not running and you only want to start Outlook with the default profile, do not use the  **Logon** method. A better alternative is shown in the following code example, `InitializeMAPI`: first, instantiate the Outlook  [Application](797003e7-ecd1-eccb-eaaf-32d6ddde8348.md) object, then reference a default folder such as the Inbox. This has the side effect of initializing MAPI to use the default profile and to make the object model fully functional.




```
Sub InitializeMAPI ()

    ' Start Outlook.
    Dim olApp As Outlook.Application
    Set olApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
    
    ' Get a session object. 
    Dim olNs As Outlook.NameSpace
    Set olNs = olApp.GetNamespace("MAPI")
    
    ' Create an instance of the Inbox folder. 
    ' If Outlook is not already running, this has the side
    ' effect of initializing MAPI.
    Dim mailFolder As Outlook.Folder
    Set mailFolder = olNs.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox)

    ' Continue to use the object model to automate Outlook.
End Sub
```

Starting in Outlook 2010, if you have multiple profiles, you have configured Outlook to always use a default profile, and you use the  **Logon** method to log on to the default profile without prompting the user, the user will receive a prompt to choose a profile anyway. To avoid this behavior, do not use the **Logon** method; use the workaround suggested in the preceding `InitializeMAPI` example instead.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Visual Basic for Applications example uses the  **Logon** method to log on to a new session, displaying the dialog box to verify the profile name and enter password.


```
Sub StartOutlook() 
    Dim myNameSpace As Outlook.NameSpace 
  
    Set myNameSpace = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
    myNameSpace.Logon "LatestProfile", , True, True 
End Sub

```
