 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns the next object in the  ** [Folders](0c814c3c-74fc-414c-982d-a0097fcb35c2.md)** collection.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **GetNext**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Folders** object.


### Return Value

A  ** [Folder](3cf6cda8-6d70-666e-2643-9d9c5b9cacfc.md)** object that represents the next object contained by the collection.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

It returns  **Nothing** if no next object exists, for example, if already positioned at the end of the collection.To ensure correct operation of the ** [GetFirst](74757061-2f38-374e-1624-f8df211a711b.md)**,  ** [GetLast](6d981844-3ac0-c6f9-b2ee-9cf495ab6488.md)**,  **GetNext**, and  ** [GetPrevious](8e7af763-e1a9-6912-c5a4-bf1ce6f73a9f.md)** methods in a large collection, call **GetFirst** before calling **GetNext** on that collection, and call **GetLast** before calling **GetPrevious**. To ensure that you are always making the calls on the same collection, create an explicit variable that refers to that collection before entering the loop.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following Visual Basic for Applications example searches the subfolders of  **Inbox** for a folder called **MyPersonalEmails** and displays a message to the user. If you do not have a subfolder called **MyPersonalEmails** in your **Inbox** folder, the example will display nothing.


```
Sub TestGetNext() 
 
 Dim nsp As Outlook.NameSpace 
 
 Dim mpf As Outlook.Folder 
 
 Dim mpfSubFolder As Outlook.Folder 
 
 Dim flds As Outlook.Folders 
 
 Dim idx As Integer 
 
 
 
 Set nsp = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
 
 Set mpf = nsp.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox) 
 
 Set flds = mpf.Folders 
 
 Set mpfSubFolder = flds.GetFirst 
 
 Do While Not mpfSubFolder Is Nothing 
 
 If mpfSubFolder.Name = "MyPersonalEmails" Then 
 
 MsgBox "The folder was found." 
 
 Exit Do 
 
 End If 
 
 Set mpfSubFolder = flds.GetNext 
 
 Loop 
 
End Sub
```
