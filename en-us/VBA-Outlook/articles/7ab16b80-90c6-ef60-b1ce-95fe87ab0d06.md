 Dim obj As Object 
 
 Dim i As Integer 
 
 
 
 Set mpfInbox = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI").GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox) 
 
 'Loop all items in the Inbox folder 
 
 For i = 1 To mpfInbox.Items.Count 
 
 Set obj = mpfInbox.Items.Item(i) 
 
 'Verify if the state of the item is olHeaderOnly 
 
 If obj.DownloadState = olHeaderOnly Then 
 
 MsgBox ("This item has not been fully downloaded.") 
 
 'Mark the item to be downloaded. 
 
 obj.MarkForDownload = olMarkedForDownload
