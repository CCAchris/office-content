## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **BeforeMinimize**( **_Cancel_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Explorer** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Cancel|Required| **Boolean**| **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True**, the operation is not completed and the explorer is not minimized.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This event can be cancelled after it has started.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example prompts the user with a message before the window is minimized. If the user clicks  **Yes**, the explorer is minimized. The sample code must be placed in a class module such as  `ThisOutlookSession`, and the  `Initialize_Handler()` subroutine should be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```
Public WithEvents myOlExp As Outlook.Explorer 
 
 
 
Sub Initalize_Handler() 
 
 Set myOlExp = Application.ActiveExplorer 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myOlExp_BeforeMinimize(Cancel As Boolean) 
 
'Prompts the user before minimizing the Explorer 
 
 
 
 Dim lngAns As Long 
 
 
 
 lngAns = MsgBox("Are you sure you want to minimize the current window?", vbYesNo) 
 
 If lngAns = vbYes Then 
 
 Cancel = False 
 
 Else 
 
 Cancel = True 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub 
 

```
