 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Occurs when the user selects the  **Forward** action for an item, or when the **Forward** method is called for the item, which is an instance of the parent object.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Forward**( **_Forward_**,  **_Cancel_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **MailItem** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Forward|Required| **Object**|The new item being forwarded.|
|Cancel|Required| **Boolean**|(Not used in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).)  **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True**, the forward operation is not completed and the new item is not displayed.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

In VBScript, if you set the return value of this function to  **False**, the forward action is not completed and the new item is not displayed.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example uses the  **Forward**event to disable forwarding on an item that has the subject "Do not forward" by setting the Cancel argument to  **True** and it also displays a message that the item may not be forwarded. The sample code must be placed in a class module such as `ThisOutlookSession`, and the  `Initialize_Handler()` routine should be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook. A e-mail item must be open when you run `Initialize_Handler()`.


```
Public WithEvents myItem As Outlook.MailItem 
 
 
 
Public Sub Initialize_Handler() 
 
 Set myItem = Application.ActiveInspector.CurrentItem 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myItem_Forward(ByVal Forward As Object, Cancel As Boolean) 
 
 If myItem.Subject = "Do not forward" Then 
 
 MsgBox "You may not forward this message!" 
 
 Cancel = True 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
