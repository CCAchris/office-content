 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Occurs when the user sizes the current  ** [Inspector](d7384756-669c-0549-1032-c3b864187994.md)**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **BeforeSize**( **_Cancel_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Inspector** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Cancel|Required| **Boolean**| **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True**, the operation is not completed and the  **Inspector** is not sized.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This event can be cancelled after it has started. If the event is cancelled, the window is not sized.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example prompts the user with a warning message before the inspector is sized. If the user clicks  **Yes**, the inspector can be sized. The sample code must be placed in a class module such as  `ThisOutlookSession`, and the  `Initialize_Handler()` subroutine should be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```
Public WithEvents myIns As Outlook.Inspector 
 
 
 
Public Sub Initalize_Handler() 
 
 Set myIns = Application.ActiveInspector 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myIns_BeforeSize(Cancel As Boolean) 
 
 'Prompts the user before resizing the window 
 
 Dim lngAns As Long 
 
 lngAns = MsgBox("Are you sure you want to resize the current window? Use your keyboard to make your selection.", vbYesNo) 
 
 If lngAns = vbYes Then 
 
 Cancel = False 
 
 Else 
 
 Cancel = True 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
