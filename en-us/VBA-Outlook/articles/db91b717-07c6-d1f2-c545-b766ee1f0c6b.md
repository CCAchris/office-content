# AddressEntries Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains a collection of addresses for an  ** [AddressList](84611afe-48b1-185b-df4b-0f004e7436ff.md)**object.

## Remarks

The object may contain zero or more  ** [AddressEntry](d4a0a85e-8bab-bc56-57bc-d70c3c570c8e.md)**objects and provides access to the entries in a transport provider's address book container.


## Example

The following example sets a reference to an  **AddressEntries** object.






```
Set myNameSpace = Application.GetNameSpace("MAPI") 
 
Set myAddressList = myNameSpace.AddressLists("Personal Address Book") 
 
Set myAddressEntries = myAddressList.AddressEntries
```

You can also index directly into the  **AddressEntries** object, returning an **AddressEntry** object.




```
Set myAddressEntry = myAddressList.AddressEntries(index)
```
