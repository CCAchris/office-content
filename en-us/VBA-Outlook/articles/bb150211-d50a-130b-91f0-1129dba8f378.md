 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A control that supports a user action specified as a command.

## Remarks

Before you use this control for the first time in the forms designer, add the Microsoft Outlook Command Button Control to the control toolbox. You can only add this control to a form region in an Outlook form using the forms designer.

The following is an example of the command button control at runtime. This control supports Microsoft Windows themes.
