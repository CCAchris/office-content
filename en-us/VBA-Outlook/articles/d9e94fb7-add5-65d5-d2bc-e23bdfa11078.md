 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns or sets a  **Boolean** that determines if the specified folder will be synchronized with the e-mail server. Read/write.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **InAppFolderSyncObject**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Folder** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If  **True**, this folder will be synchronized when the "Application Folders"  ** [SyncObject](099865b6-767f-8022-6839-875624f284f7.md)** is synchronized. If **False**, the folder will not synchronize. 

This is equivalent to selecting the check box for this folder in the  **Application Folders** group on the **Send/Receive** dialog box.

If this property is set to  **True**, and the "Application Folders"  **SyncObject** does not already exist, a **SyncObject** will be automatically created. The "Application Folders" **SyncObject** is the only **Send/Receive** group that can be programmatically modified.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example sets the Inbox folder to be synchronized when the "Application Folders"  **SyncObject** object is synchronized. The **InAppFolderSyncObject** property is used in conjunction with the ** [AppFolders](711ebc16-12ac-9df3-31af-a883f438814f.md)** property of the ** [SyncObjects](88e59f63-d834-b174-bbda-0af0cf2d0520.md)** collection.


```
Public Sub appfolders() 
 Dim nsp As Outlook.NameSpace 
 Dim sycs As Outlook.SyncObjects 
 Dim syc As Outlook.SyncObject 
 Dim mpfInbox As Outlook.Folder 
 
 Set nsp = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
 Set sycs = nsp.SyncObjects 
 'Return the Application Folder SyncObject. 
 Set syc = sycs.AppFolders 
 'Get the Inbox folder. 
 Set mpfInbox = nsp.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox) 
 'Set the Inbox folder to be synchronized when the Application 
 'Folder's SyncObject is synchronized. 
 mpfInbox.InAppFolderSyncObject = True 
 'Start the synchronization. 
 syc.Start 
End Sub
```
