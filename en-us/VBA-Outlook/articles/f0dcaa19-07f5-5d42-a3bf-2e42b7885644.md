# NameSpace Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents an abstract root object for any data source.

## Remarks

The object itself provides methods for logging in and out, accessing storage objects directly by ID, accessing certain special default folders directly, and accessing data sources owned by other users.

Use  ** [GetNameSpace](6175d0d9-5a61-ce45-35c0-b70895d757b3.md)**("MAPI") to return the Outlook  **NameSpace** object from the ** [Application](797003e7-ecd1-eccb-eaaf-32d6ddde8348.md)**object.

The only data source supported is MAPI, which allows access to all Outlook data stored in the user's mail stores.
