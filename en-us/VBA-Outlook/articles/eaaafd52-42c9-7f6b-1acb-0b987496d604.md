## Example

The following code sample shows how to obtain the business phone number, office location, and job title for all Exchange user entries in the Exchange Global Address List. It first uses  ** [AddressList.AddressListType](3a62cdec-3d8d-3bcf-b2c3-f9dd496fd6e0.md)** to find the Global Address List. For each **AddressEntry** on that ** [AddressList](84611afe-48b1-185b-df4b-0f004e7436ff.md)**, it uses  **AddressEntryUserType** to verify if the **AddressEntry** represents an Exchange user. After it finds an Exchange user, it uses **GetExchangeUser** to obtain and print the various pieces of data for the user.


```
Sub DemoAE() 
 
 Dim colAL As Outlook.AddressLists 
 
 Dim oAL As Outlook.AddressList 
 
 Dim colAE As Outlook.AddressEntries 
 
 Dim oAE As Outlook.AddressEntry 
 
 Dim oExUser As Outlook.ExchangeUser 
 
 Set colAL = Application.Session.AddressLists 
 
 For Each oAL In colAL 
 
 'Address list is an Exchange Global Address List 
 
 If oAL.AddressListType = olExchangeGlobalAddressList Then 
 
 Set colAE = oAL.AddressEntries 
 
 For Each oAE In colAE 
 
 If oAE.AddressEntryUserType = _ 
 
 olExchangeUserAddressEntry _ 
 
 Or oAE.AddressEntryUserType = _ 
 
 olExchangeRemoteUserAddressEntry Then 
 
 Set oExUser = oAE.GetExchangeUser 
 
 Debug.Print (oExUser.JobTitle) 
 
 Debug.Print (oExUser.OfficeLocation) 
 
 Debug.Print (oExUser.BusinessTelephoneNumber) 
 
 End If 
 
 Next 
 
 End If 
 
 Next 
 
End Sub
