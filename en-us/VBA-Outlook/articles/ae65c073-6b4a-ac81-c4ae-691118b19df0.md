 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Occurs before the explorer goes to a new folder, either as a result of user action or through program code.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **BeforeFolderSwitch**( **_NewFolder_**,  **_Cancel_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Explorer** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|NewFolder|Required| **Object**|The  ** [Folder](3cf6cda8-6d70-666e-2643-9d9c5b9cacfc.md)**object the explorer is switching to.|
|Cancel|Required| **Boolean**| **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True**, navigation is cancelled, and the current folder is not changed.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This event is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).

If the folder being switched to is in a namespace that doesn't support automation (such as the file system),  _NewFolder_ is **Nothing**.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This sample prevents a user from switching to a folder named "Off Limits". The sample code must be placed in a class module such as  `ThisOutlookSession`, and the  `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook. To run this example without errors, make sure a folder by the name 'Off Limits' exists in the folder displayed in the active explorer.


```
Public WithEvents myOlExp As Outlook.Explorer 
 
 
 
Public Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myOlExp = Application.ActiveExplorer 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myOlExp_BeforeFolderSwitch(ByVal NewFolder As Object, Cancel As Boolean) 
 
 If NewFolder.Name = "Off Limits" Then 
 
 MsgBox "You do not have permission to access this folder." 
 
 Cancel = True 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
